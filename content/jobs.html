  <p>
    The MapLibre Organization is looking for people who would like to support
    the community on a paid basis. If you are interested in working on
    open-source mapping libraries and helping the community to get the most out
    of their contributions, MapLibre could be a great place for you.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have three different roles: Coordinator, Maintainer, and Developer. The
    Coordinator focuses on organizational work, Maintainers take care of a
    GitHub repository, and Developers work on
    <a href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/wiki/Bounty-System"
      >Bounties</a
    >. You find more information about the paid roles in our
    <a href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/wiki/Paid-Roles"
      >wiki on GitHub</a
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    To be able to hire people worldwide, we require the applicants to be
    freelancers who take care of income taxes etc themselves and send the
    MapLibre Organization an invoice for their work.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Coordinator and Maintainers track their time and work on an agreed
    hourly rate. Please indicate what your hourly rate would be and how many
    hours per week you would be available.
  </p>

  <p>
    The roles are open to part-time work, so if you for example take care of
    your family and would like to work one hour per day on open-source, then it
    is completely fine to apply with an availability of a few hours per week.
  </p>

  <p>
    We understand that everyone's life is different and will consider all
    applications independent of a person's background, gender, education, or
    nationality.
  </p>

  <p>The MapLibre Organization is looking forward to your application!</p>
