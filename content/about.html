  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    MapLibre is a community-governed non-profit organization that develops,
    maintains, and promotes free, open-source software. Each project under the
    MapLibre umbrella is part of the map visualization stack, from the raw data
    to the map visualization and interaction.
  </p>
  <p>
    MapLibre started as an open-source fork of the popular Mapbox rendering
    libraries after their switch to a proprietary license in December 2020.
    Often "MapLibre" still refers to these key rendering libraries: MapLibre GL
    JS, which is a TypeScript library for rendering maps in web browsers, and
    MapLibre GL Native, which is a C++ library to show maps in mobile apps on
    iOS, Android, and other native targets.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a community, we believe in building and maintaining freely licensed
    libraries that enable developers worldwide to build vital tools using maps.
  </p>

  <h2 class="mt-6">Governing Board</h2>
  <p>
    The MapLibre Governing Board represents the broader community, defines the
    overall direction of the MapLibre Organization, and has the authority over
    all financial decisions. The Governing Board is elected by the MapLibre
    Voting Members, see the
    <a href="{{< ref " charter.html" >}}">MapLibre Charter</a> for more details
    on our Governance.
  </p>
  <p>The following people serve currently on the MapLibre Governing Board:</p>

    MapLibre with its open nature is uniquely positioned to support high-quality
    geospatial visualizations in science, politics, tech, and arts. Because the
    world is changing so fast, it's never been more important than right now to
    invest in this effort.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a Board member of MapLibre, I'm focusing on getting the long-term
    strategic decisions right, so the user story will be as simple and intuitive
    as possible. That means making sure that it's trivial to use MapLibre across
    web frameworks, game engines, native cross-platform compilers, etc. We will
    achieve that by supporting modern graphics APIs and embracing partnerships
    amongst projects in the open ecosystem.

    I believe we have a true chance for greatness with MapLibre. As a Board
    member and an Open Source promoter I believe in transparency and giving back
    to the community what's rightfully theirs. Moving this project forward to
    new technologies and new markets will be my main focus, making sure we
    harness the power of the community by constantly updating our technology
    stack.

    In the day I work as a group leader in Dell Technologies and at night I'm
    working on an open source hobby project called Israel Hiking Map
    (co-founder) which is a small navigation app that uses Capacitor and thus
    maplibre-gl-js to allow outdoor activities in Israel (hiking, biking, 4wd
    driving, running etc...).
  </p>
  <p>
    The contribution that started my journey in MapLibre was the addition of the
    "addProtocol" method which opened up a world of opportunities to extend
    maplibre like never before.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've pushed forward the typescript migration along with the modernization of
    the maplibre-gl-js stack, and helped with the 3D terrain effort.
  </p>
  <p>
    I generally enjoy participating in open source projects from the development
    side of things and you probably know me from the annoying code review
    comments I leave when you open a PR ðŸ˜Š.

    As part of the founding group, I strongly believe that open-source map
    rendering libraries are valuable for the ecosystem (from individuals to
    large organizations), and that's why I initially led (along with my fearless
    fellow founding members) the push to ensure there was a single,
    vendor-neutral, and community-led fork of Mapbox GL JS, and I'm really
    excited to see the community and engagement grow over the last years. So
    far, I've been most involved in the background, from Twitter-spamming at the
    beginning to build an initial group, to helping build the organizational
    charter, talking to sponsors, writing organizational docs and presentations,
    and ensuring we have a solid foundation for the future.
  </p>
  <p>My focuses for the upcoming months:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Finalize the organization structure while supporting a Governing Board
      culture and habits that ensure it will succeed long-term
    </li>
    <li>
      Ensure MapLibre GL Native becomes a much healthier project with near
      parity to GL JS
    </li>
    <li>
      Foster the continued development of MapLibre RS, a prototype of a future,
      unified cross-platform renderer
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The company (Stadia Maps) I co founded uses MapLibre projects daily, and I
    often use the libraries in small personal projects. As a result, I see a lot
    of potential as the community continues to mature and collaborate, both
    personally and professionally.
  </p>
  <p>Here's to the strong future of MapLibre! ðŸš€</p>

    As one of the founders, I have had a chance to help to shape the MapLibre
    project into the current form. My vision for the project is to make it the
    best rendering library for maps out there - used by millions of people every
    day - vendor/provider independent - and with true community governance. Many
    of my ideas where to go practically are drafted in our
    <a href="https://roadmap.maplibre.org/">roadmap</a>. Some of them I have
    helped to make happen practically with the assistance of my team:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>First release of MapLibre SDK for Android and iOS (Native)</li>
    <li>
      Design project logo, visual identity, presentation template, first version
      of website <a href="https://maplibre.org/">https://maplibre.org</a> with
      animated map and demotiles for CI and tests - all contributed to the
      project as there was a need for it
    </li>
    <li>
      Initial version of the pitch slidedeck & sponsorship presentation for
      successful fund-raising and setup of donations
    </li>
    <li>
      Promoting the project on conferences (SOTM, FOSS4G), in press (<a
        href="https://opensource.com"
        >opensource.com</a
      >,...) and on social media
    </li>
    <li>
      Technical Steering Committee organization and moderation, and active work
      on current Board
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I believe JavaScript and Native are the core and essential projects of the
    MapLibre organization, and especially Native needs more love and focus right
    now - to get to parity with JS. These are the cornerstones on which other
    projects grow - and the success of MapLibre depends on the success of the
    two. Focus is important - but there is a need for new MapLibre projects too
    (hopefully the upcoming Planetiler, continued innovation in Rust or other
    tools) which brings benefits to the community and allows larger reach and
    will shape the project's future, and they are also really cool technically.

    I am an entrepreneur and software architect. I am a challenge seeker, Swiss
    resident born in the Czech Republic, and father of two boys. I hope to be
    able to contribute with my experience and from my position of CEO of
    <a href="https://maptiler.com">MapTiler.com</a> - acting on the board as a
    representative of the vendors who are using the MapLibre in production
    systems with thousands of customers. I have practical experience from board
    meetings, education in management and board governance from IMD in
    Switzerland, degree in Computer Science and PhD in cartography. Furthermore,
    my visionary mind and workaholism helped to shape
    <a href="https://openmaptiles.org">OpenMapTiles.org</a>,
    <a href="https://epsg.io">EPSG.io</a>, GDAL2Tiles,
    <a href="https://oldmapsonline.org">OldMapsOnline.org</a>, etc. More about

    I feel it is important to show what I did so far, and explain how I see
    MapLibre's future. I have served on the Board since MapLibre's inception, so
    here it goes...
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I kick-started MapLibre via a Twitter post. There are some good replies
      including the one from the Mapbox CEO just eight minutes after my initial
      tweet...
    </li>
    <li>
      Created the MapLibre GitHub organization, set up OpenCollective banking
      and distributed donations acting as the organization treasurer
    </li>
    <li>
      Coordinated and worked on initial code rebranding, CI work, and initial
      NPM publishing, lots of work on charter (thanks Oliver for drafting it!),
      ...
    </li>
    <li>
      Presented MapLibre at conferences like State of the Map US and the
      upcoming FOSS4G
    </li>
    <li>
      Engaged in numerous coordination and sponsorship talks with organizations
      like the OSM board, Amazon, Meta (FB), Microsoft, and others, including
      those at the conferences. The recent large donation from Meta, and
      hopefully a few more upcoming ones are due in part to the SOTM-US
      conference hallway talks.
    </li>
    <li>
      Convinced several important repositories to join MapLibre: MapLibre-RS,
      Martin, mbtileserver-rs, and hopefully soon -- Planetiler.
    </li>
    <li>
      As a developer, I mostly hack on the backend tooling like Martin - the
      tile server framework that should eventually serve from PG, mbtiles, and
      other formats, as well as support server side rendering.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Going forward, here is my vision and how I see my role...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Listen to the community. Mediate between the needs of all contributors and
      supporters, large and small. Make sure we all align on the roadmap of the
      projects, both near and long term.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure MapLibre stays independent from any one company, and provides
      value to everyone who wants to do maps.
    </li>
    <li>
      I think MapLibre should supply the whole stack of features for developers,
      to go from the raw data like OSM and Natural Earth to the interactive map
      in a browser or apps. This means MapLibre should encourage innovation at
      all levels of the stack, provide tools to create and serve tiles, engage
      with new standards for 3D, projections, globe to flat zooms, experiment
      with joining native and javascript stacks (e.g. try Rust web assemblies),
      ... . The more interesting ideas we try, the more likely we will find the
      good ones bringing even more value (and fun) to everyone involved.
    </li>
    <li>
      No money for the Board - I believe it would create too much conflict of
      interest if the Board is allowed to decide on money allocation, and later
      turn around and receive that money. We all should decide for ourselves -
      do we want to represent the community and steer the projects forward, or
      do we want to receive payments for our efforts? I feel having both may put
      too much power in too few hands.
    </li>
  </ul>
