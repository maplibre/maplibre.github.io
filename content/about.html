  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    MapLibre is a community-governed collection of open source mapping
    libraries. As a community, we believe in building and maintaining freely
    licensed libraries that enable developers worldwide to build vital tools
    using maps.
  </p>
  <p>
    Motivated by the 2020 transition to proprietary licensing for
    Mapbox&nbsp;GL&nbsp;JS, the initial libraries are forks of the
    Mapbox&nbsp;GL ecosystem‚Äîfor the web and mobile platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our goal is to continue building on the foundation of Mapbox‚Äôs original
    open-source code under the BSD license without tracking end-users.
  </p>

  <h2 class="mt-6">Governing Board</h2>
  <p>
    The MapLibre Governing Board represents the broader community, defines the
    overall direction of the MapLibre Organization, and has the authority over
    all financial decisions. The Governing Board is elected by the MapLibre
    Voting Members.
  </p>
  <p>The following people serve currently on the MapLibre Governing Board:</p>

  <p>Hi, i'm Birk.</p>
  <p>
    To support the organisation and give you all some options, I'm nominating
    myself for the Governing Board.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a maintainer of maplibre-gl-js, and to some extend maplibre-gl-native
    too, and I have put in a lot of effort into modernising our libraries so we
    are ready to take them further. I think MapLibre is uniquely positioned to
    support high quality visualisations in science, politics, tech and more, and
    this suite of open collaborative tools is in my opinion very important to
    have, and I care a lot that we can keep it open and expand upon the feature
    set to keep it relevant too.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first thing I noticed when I joined the community was how friendly and
    welcoming it is, and that is really why I know MapLibre as an umbrella will
    be a success, because it's an inviting environment. As a board member, I'll
    be focusing on getting the long-term strategical decisions for MapLibre
    right, such as a push towards webgpu when it's stabilising, and on fostering
    collaboration and partnerships in our ecosystem. I'll also focus on the user
    story, because no matter if the map is supposed to run in with a specific
    web framework, flutter, expo, native or bevy, MapLibre should be trivial to
    include.
  </p>
  <p>
    I typically use MapLibre the aid NGOs by building visual tools around public
    api's to democratise data. An example of such a project is this agricultural
    map of Denmark, which i.e. Greenpeace volunteers use as a key tool. I
    believe everybody who has a creative impulse should have the freedom to
    express it without a fee per map render.

  <p>Thank you for your time üôè</p>

  <p>Hi everyone!</p>
  <p>
    My name is Harel Mazor and I would like to nominate myself for the Governing
    Board.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm currently maintaining maplibre-gl-js (You might have seen some of my
    annoying comments if you have submitted a PR there :-)).
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm working on an open source hobby project called Israel Hiking Map
    (co-founder) which is a small navigation app that uses Cordova and thus
    maplibre-gl-js to allow outdoor activities in Israel (hiking, biking, 4wd
    driving, running etc...).
  </p>
  <p>
    I've been attending every steering committee meeting since the first time I
    joined after adding the addProtocol capabilities to maplibre-gl-js.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've pushed forward the typescript migration along with the modernization of
    the maplibre-gl-js stack, and helped with the 3D terrain effort.
  </p>
  <p>
    I generally enjoy participating in open source projects from the development
    side of things.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm currently employed at Dell as a group leader and previously done roles
    as a team leader and architect in the Semi-conductor industry.

  <p>Hi all!</p>
  <p>
    I'm Luke Seelenbinder, and it'd be my pleasure to have the opportunity to
    continue serving on the governing board.
  </p>
  <p>
    As part of the founding group, I strongly believe that open-source map
    rendering libraries are valuable for the ecosystem (from individuals to
    large organizations), and that's why I initially led (along with my fearless
    fellow founding members) the push to ensure there was a single,
    vendor-neutral, and community-led fork of Mapbox GL JS, and I'm really
    excited to see the community and engagement grow over the last year+. So
    far, I've been most involved in the background, from Twitter-spamming at the
    beginning to build an initial group, to helping build the organizational
    charter, talking to sponsors, writing organizational docs and presentations,
    and ensuring we have a solid foundation for the future, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you choose to reelect me, I hope to achieve the following over the next
    term:
  </p>
  <p>
    Finalize the organization structure while supporting a governing board
    culture and habits that ensure it will succeed long-term See MapLibre GL
    Native become a much healthier project with near parity to GL JS Foster the
    continued development of MapLibre RS, a prototype of a future, unified
    cross-platform renderer I use MapLibre projects daily via my company. Both
    personally and professionally, I see a lot of potential as the community
    continues to mature and collaborate.
  </p>
  <p>Here's to the strong future of MapLibre! üöÄ</p>

  <p>Hi everybody.</p>
  <p>
    Here is Petr Pridal alias Klokan. I would like to offer my services to the
    MapLibre project - as self-nominee for the governing board. I would be
    honoured to continue to serve on the board - to assist in the further
    project growth and the next steps.
  </p>
  <p>
    As one of the founders, I have had a chance to help to shape the MapLibre
    project into the current form. My vision for the project is to make it the
    best rendering library for maps out there - used by millions of people every
    day - vendor/provider independent - and with true community governance. Many
    of my ideas where to go practically are drafted in
    https://roadmap.maplibre.org/. Some of them I have helped to make happen
    practically with the assistance of my team:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>First release of MapLibre SDK for Android and iOS (Native)</li>
    <li>
      Design project logo, visual identity, presentation template, first version
      of website https://maplibre.org/ with animated map and demotiles for CI
      and tests - all contributed to the project as there was a need for it
    </li>
    <li>
      Initial version of the pitch slidedeck & sponsorship presentation for
      successful fund-raising and setup of donations
    </li>
    <li>
      Promoting the project on conferences (SOTM, FOSS4G), in press
      (opensource.com,...) and on social media
    </li>
    <li>
      Technical steering committee organization and moderation, and active work
      on current board
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I believe JavaScript and Native are the core and essential projects of the
    MapLibre organization, and especially Native needs more love and focus right
    now - to get to parity with JS. These are the cornerstones on which other
    projects grow - and the success of MapLibre depends on the success of the
    two. Focus is important - but there is a need for new MapLibre projects too
    (hopefully the upcoming Planetiler, continued innovation in Rust or other
    tools) which brings benefits to community and allow larger reach and will
    shape the project future, and they are also really cool technically.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am an entrepreneur and software architect. I am a challenge seeker, Swiss
    resident born in the Czech Republic, and father of two boys. I hope to be
    able to contribute with my experience and from my position of CEO of
    MapTiler.com - acting on the board as a representative of the vendors who
    are using the MapLibre in production systems with thousands of customers. I
    have practical experience from board meetings, education in management and
    board governance from IMD in Switzerland, degree in Computer Science and PhD
    in cartography. Furthermore, my visionary mind and workaholism helped to
    shape OpenMapTiles.org, EPSG.io, GDAL2Tiles, OldMapsOnline.org, etc. More

  <p>Let's bring the MapLibre project to the next level - together :-)</p>

  <p>
    I would like to nominate myself to the board of MapLibre. I feel it is
    important to show what I did so far, and explain how I see MapLibre's
    future. I have served on the board since MapLibre inception, so here it
    goes...
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I kick-started MapLibre via a Twitter post. There are some good replies
      including the one from MapBox CEO just eight minutes after my initial
      tweet...
    </li>
    <li>
      Created MapLibre GitHub organization, set up OpenCollective banking and
      distributed donations acting as the organization treasurer
    </li>
    <li>
      Coordinated and worked on initial code rebranding, CI work, and initial
      NPM publishing, lots of work on charter (thanks Oliver for drafting it!),
      ...
    </li>
    <li>
      Presented MapLibre at conferences like State of the Map US and the
      upcoming FOSS4G
    </li>
    <li>
      Engaged in numerous coordination and sponsorship talks with organizations
      like OSM board, Amazon, Meta (FB), Microsoft, and others, including those
      at the conferences. The recent large donation from Meta, and hopefully a
      few more upcoming ones are due in part to the SOTM-US conference hallway
      talks.
    </li>
    <li>
      Convinced several important repositories to join MapLibre: MapLibre-RS,
      Martin, mbtileserver-rs, and hopefully soon -- Planetiler.
    </li>
    <li>
      As a developer, I mostly hack on the backend tooling like Martin - the
      tile server framework that should eventually serve from PG, mbtiles, and
      other formats, as well as support server side rendering.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Going forward, here is my vision and how I see my role...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Listen to the community. Mediate between the needs of all contributors and
      supporters, large and small. Make sure we all align on the roadmap of the
      projects, both near and long term.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure MapLibre stays independent from any one company, and provides
      value to everyone who wants to do maps.
    </li>
    <li>
      I think MapLibre should supply the whole stack of features for developers,
      to go from the raw data like OSM and Natural Earth to the interactive map
      in a browser or apps. This means MapLibre should encourage innovation at
      all levels of the stack, provide tools to create and serve tiles, engage
      with new standards for 3D, projections, globe to flat zooms, experiment
      with joining native and javascript stacks (e.g. try Rust web assemblies),
      ... . The more interesting ideas we try, the more likely we will find the
      good ones bringing even more value (and fun) to everyone involved.
    </li>
    <li>
      No money for the board - I believe it would create too much conflict of
      interest if the board is allowed to decide on money allocation, and later
      turn around and receive that money. We all should decide for ourselves -
      do we want to represent the community and steer the projects forward, or
      do we want to receive payments for our efforts? I feel having both may put
      too much power in too few hands.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Your suggestions and feedback are welcome of course :)</p>

  <h2 class="mt-6">Meetings</h2>

  <p>
    We have regular meetings where we discuss technical details,
    community-related stuff, and future development.
