  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    MapLibre is a community-governed non-profit organization that develops,
    maintains, and promotes free, open-source software. Each project under the
    MapLibre umbrella is part of the map visualization stack, from the raw data
    to the map visualization and interaction.
  </p>
  <p>
    MapLibre started as an open-source fork of the popular Mapbox rendering
    libraries after their switch to a proprietary license in December 2020.
    Often "MapLibre" still refers to these key rendering libraries: MapLibre GL
    JS, which is a TypeScript library for rendering maps in web browsers, and
    MapLibre GL Native, which is a C++ library to show maps in mobile apps on
    iOS, Android, and other native targets.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a community, we believe in building and maintaining freely licensed
    libraries that enable developers worldwide to build vital tools using maps.
  </p>

    There are many active and motivated individuals on the board of the
