    The MapLibre Organization is community-governed, and we are thankful for all
    contributions no matter how small or large they are. The following companies
    decided to join the MapLibre Sponsorship Program and support us financially
    to ensure that the MapLibre Organization has a healthy and sustainable
    future where we can build mapping software together in a friendly and
    welcoming community.
