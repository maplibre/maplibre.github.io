As one of the founders, I have had a chance to help to shape the MapLibre
project into the current form. My vision for the project is to make it the
best rendering library for maps out there - used by millions of people every
day - vendor/provider independent - and with true community governance. Many
of my ideas where to go practically are drafted in our
<a href="https://maplibre.org/roadmap">roadmap</a>. Some of them I have
helped to make happen practically with the assistance of my team:

- First release of MapLibre SDK for Android and iOS (Native)
- Design project logo, visual identity, presentation template, first version
  of website <a href="https://maplibre.org/">https://maplibre.org</a> with
  animated map and demotiles for CI and tests - all contributed to the
  project as there was a need for it
- Initial version of the pitch slidedeck & sponsorship presentation for
  successful fund-raising and setup of donations
- Promoting the project on conferences (SOTM, FOSS4G), in press (opensource.com,...) and on social media
- Technical Steering Committee organization and moderation, and active work
  on current Board

I believe JavaScript and Native are the core and essential projects of the
MapLibre organization, and especially Native needs more love and focus right
now - to get to parity with JS. These are the cornerstones on which other
projects grow - and the success of MapLibre depends on the success of the
two. Focus is important - but there is a need for new MapLibre projects too
(hopefully the upcoming Planetiler, continued innovation in Rust or other
tools) which brings benefits to the community and allows larger reach and
will shape the project's future, and they are also really cool technically.

I am an entrepreneur and software architect. I am a challenge seeker, Swiss
resident born in the Czech Republic, and father of two boys. I hope to be
able to contribute with my experience and from my position of CEO of
<a href="https://maptiler.com">MapTiler.com</a> - acting on the board as a
representative of the vendors who are using the MapLibre in production
systems with thousands of customers. I have practical experience from board
meetings, education in management and board governance from IMD in
Switzerland, degree in Computer Science and PhD in cartography. Furthermore,
my visionary mind and workaholism helped to shape
<a href="https://openmaptiles.org">OpenMapTiles.org</a>,
<a href="https://epsg.io">EPSG.io</a>, GDAL2Tiles,
<a href="https://oldmapsonline.org">OldMapsOnline.org</a>, etc. More about
me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/klokan/">LinkedIn</a> and

Let's bring the MapLibre project to the next level - together :-)</p>
