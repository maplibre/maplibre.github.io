End? No, the journey doesn't end here. MapLibre is another path. One that we
all must take. On 2020-12-08 22:42:56 UTC MapLibre restarted mapping with its
mission to provide freedom and independence. In the end, this is what everybody
is seeking, from a little project to enterprise endeavours. I am Duje, and I am
assisting as a Coordinator to help maintain what the community has built so
carefully which means to me:

- Assure MapLibre's fundraising and a healthy Sponsorship Program to keep
  MapLibre on the map
- Listen to and discuss with the vivid community which corner to turn next
- Make MapLibre seen and accessible to everyone

To sidewalk talks where everyone feels comfortable in the MapLibre world.
