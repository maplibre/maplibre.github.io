MapLibre with its open nature is uniquely positioned to support high-quality
geospatial visualizations in science, politics, tech, and arts. Because the
world is changing so fast, it's never been more important than right now to
invest in this effort.

As a Board member of MapLibre, I'm focusing on getting the long-term
strategic decisions right, so the user story will be as simple and intuitive
as possible. That means making sure that it's trivial to use MapLibre across
web frameworks, game engines, native cross-platform compilers, etc. We will
achieve that by supporting modern graphics APIs and embracing partnerships
amongst projects in the open ecosystem.
