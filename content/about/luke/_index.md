As part of the founding group, I strongly believe that open-source map
rendering libraries are valuable for the ecosystem (from individuals to
large organizations), and that's why I initially led (along with my fearless
fellow founding members) the push to ensure there was a single,
vendor-neutral, and community-led fork of Mapbox GL JS, and I'm really
excited to see the community and engagement grow over the last years. So
far, I've been most involved in the background, from Twitter-spamming at the
beginning to build an initial group, to helping build the organizational
charter, talking to sponsors, writing organizational docs and presentations,
and ensuring we have a solid foundation for the future.

My focuses for the upcoming months:

- Finalize the organization structure while supporting a Governing Board
  culture and habits that ensure it will succeed long-term
- Ensure MapLibre Native becomes a much healthier project with near
  parity to GL JS
- Foster the continued development of MapLibre RS, a prototype of a future,
  unified cross-platform renderer

The company (Stadia Maps) I co founded uses MapLibre projects daily, and I
often use the libraries in small personal projects. As a result, I see a lot
of potential as the community continues to mature and collaborate, both
personally and professionally.

Here's to the strong future of MapLibre! ðŸš€
