# MapLibre Newsletter - May 2023

## Highlights

We would like to thank our first sponsor [Mierune](https://www.mierune.co.jp/) for their continued trust in MapLibre.

Many real-world applications have been built with MapLibre. As suggested in https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/discussions/242 it is about bringing the Community together. Implementing new ideas is what will make MapLibre thrive further. We want to recognize all of your efforts, collectively, and so decided to expand on the idea of the [MapLibre Innovation Lab](https://lab.maplibre.org/).

#### Bounty Programm ðŸ’°

We would like to remind you about our news in April:

"The amounts allocated to [Bounty Directions](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22bounty+direction%22) are pre-approved budgets. If an individual or a company would like to work on a Bounty Direction but requires more funding, they can make a request to the Governing Board to increase the budget of a Bounty Direction."

In the upcoming days, you will find a step-by-step guide on what to hand in for a "Budget Increase" in our [wiki](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/wiki/Bounty-System).
