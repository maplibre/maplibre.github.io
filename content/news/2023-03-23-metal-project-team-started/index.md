The Metal project team has started working! The goal is to deliver a Metal beta release for MapLibre Native by the end of 2023.

AWS and Meta are teaming up in this effort because they both recognize the importance of Metal as a modern graphics backend on Apple devices.

The implementation will follow the modularization and Metal [design proposals](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/tree/main/design-proposals) that were accepted at the end of 2022.

We will keep you updated on the current status of the Metal project team in our newsletter and on https://maplibre.org/roadmap/metal.

Stay tuned!
