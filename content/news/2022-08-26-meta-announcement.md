Meta has been involved in the MapLibre Organization since the very beginning, helped setting up the initial fork, and provided guidance on non-trivial questions around licensing.

Open source is an important part of Meta’s approach to map building. Our map building teams contribute to and maintain a number of open source projects such as OpenSFM, Mapillary Tools, Mapillary’s Python SDK, the Daylight Map Distribution, RapiD Editor for OpenStreetMap and many more. Meta is also a significant user of open source tools such as QGIS, GDAL/OGR, and PostGIS. Additionally, Meta supports open source communities such as OSGeo, the OpenStreetMap Foundation, and local OpenStreetMap chapters through grants, membership, and conference sponsorship.
