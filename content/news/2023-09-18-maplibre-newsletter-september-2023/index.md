# MapLibre Newsletter - September 2023

### Governing Board Elections

It is already one year now that MapLibre has an elected Governing Board, and as the Board members serve a one-year-term, it was time for new Governing Board Elections. We held the Elections and all existing Board members have been re-elected. Read more [here](https://maplibre.org/news/2023-08-30-results-governing-board-election/).

## MapLibre Style Specification

Last month, several design proposals have been opened in the [MapLibre Style Spec repo on GitHub](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-style-spec). Here is an overview:

- Add a `pitch` style spec expression similar to the `zoom` expression. [#346](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-style-spec/issues/346).
- Support arbitrary base and interval values in RasterDEM sources [#326](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-style-spec/issues/326).
- Change default value for text-font to Noto Sans Regular [#311](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-style-spec/issues/311)

Furthermore, there is an ongoing discussion about how to support more writing systems such as Indic scripts with Harfbuzz text shaping and what is needed in terms of style spec properties for text shaping. Read more [here](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-style-spec/discussions/312).
