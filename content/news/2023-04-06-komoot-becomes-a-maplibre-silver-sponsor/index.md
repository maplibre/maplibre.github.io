Komoot is an app that lets you find, plan, and share adventures with its easy route planner. Driven by a love for nature, and powered by the outdoor community’s recommendations, komoot helps you explore more of the great outdoors—wherever and however you want.

"We use MapLibre for map rendering in our web and mobile app, and thanks to the cross-platform nature of MapLibre we have visually consistent results on all of our maps." says Daniel Gard, co-founder of komoot.

MapLibre is proud to have gained komoot as a Silver Sponsor and we thank you for trusting us. Your support strengthens our community and makes MapLibre more sustainable. Great to have you!
