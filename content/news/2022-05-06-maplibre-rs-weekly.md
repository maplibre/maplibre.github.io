[maplibre-rs](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs) is an upcoming and cross-platform vector map renderer written in Rust. If you want to get in touch with the developers visit the [#maplibre:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#mapr:matrix.org) chat or our Slack at [osmus.slack.com](https://osmus.slack.com/).

## 📰 News

About one months ago the MapLibre organisation aquired the maplibre-rs project (formerly known as mapr). I was happy about the opertunity and the support from the Geo community. It seems like I was not the first with the idea of a map rendering engine in Rust. In the discussion [#18](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs/discussions/18) a lot of people showed what they have been working on in the past.
The maplibre-rs project is not the place where we can bundle our efforts to create a new, unique and fun rendering engine.

About the same time researchers form the "University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HES-SO/HEIG-VD)" from Switzerland approached the maplibre-rs project. The maplibre-rs implementation should serve as a proof of concept to proof that a truely cross-platform experience is possible with WebGPU and Rust.

I'm looking forward what we will create in the following year!

## 🏠 House Keeping

The following will summarizes what happened last week on GitHub.

### 🎁 New Features

- [#13](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs/pull/13), [#33](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs/pull/33) Add support for Gradle
  > It's not possible to easily use maplibre-rs on Android. Sadly only fullscreen is supported right now.
- [#15](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs/pull/15) Add support for XCode and Swift Packages
  > It's not possible to easily use maplibre-rs on iOS and macOS. Sadly only fullscreen is supported right now.
- [#43](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs/pull/43) Create a proper web package
  > It's not possible to easily use maplibre-rs on the web via an NPM package.
- [#46](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs/pull/46) Prepare for publishing on crates.io
  > Some preparations are finished and maplibre-rs is available [here](https://crates.io/crates/maplibre)
- [#38](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs/pull/38) optimize zoom bounds
  > Computing some coordinates if faster now.
- [#63](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs/pull/63) Move platform specific code to web
  > Most of the web related suff lives now in the `web` crates and no longer in the core crate `maplibre`.
