The MapLibre Governing Board selected [Oliver Wipfli](https://github.com/wipfli) to work as Coordinator of the MapLibre Organization. Oliver did this very well until now in his free time, and we need immediate action.

We allocated an initial budget cap of $33k for the immediate kick-off and Oliver will work as a freelancer and invoice his time.

Deliverables:

- Sponsorship - communication, formalized process, fundraising
- Recruitment campaign - collect a list of candidates for the roles of maintainer, developer (keen on bounties), backup coordinator and secretary
- Active hiring and interviews: Hire a maintainer for MapLibre Native
- Implement a bounty system
- Develop and document organizational processes - budget, roles, time tracking, roadmaps
- Ensure smooth operation - meetings announcements, communication

Two members of the Governing Board will act as an Executive Committee and meet with Oliver every two weeks.

We are glad to have you, Oliver, and look forward to building MapLibre's future together with you!
