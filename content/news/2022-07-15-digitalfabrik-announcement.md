The [Tür an Tür - Digitalfabrik gGmbH](https://tuerantuer.de/digitalfabrik/) (short: Digitalfabrik), located in Germany, supports MapLibre non-materially and materially since 2021. Thank you Digitalfabrik, we are very happy, that you support our goals and development.

We interviewed several employees of Digitalfabrik to better understand their goals, needs and vision.

## What is Digitalfabrik and how many people work there?

Digitalfabrik is a non-profit startup founded at Technical University of Munich (TUM) and develops digital solutions in the areas of migration, asylum and integration. We achieve impact by providing software development services and consulting to public administrations, social associations and organizations. All technology we use and provide is free and open-source.

In 2015 and the following years, municipalities all over Germany had similar challenges regarding multilingual information for refugees. The Digitalfabrik developed a FLOSS solution called [Integreat](https://integreat-app.de). Over 80 municipalities are using the Integreat platform in 2022 to provide local information to migrants and refugees.

We are a team of about 30 people located all over Germany. The majority of our employees work in part-time together with lots of volunteers.

## Why do you support MapLibre?

MapLibre is currently used in the [Integreat](https://integreat-app.de) mobile and web app. All software we use must be open-source and should be published under a libre and permissive license. We also want to avoid any vendor lock-in. Because of these requirements, MapLibre is an essential component in our ecosystem. No other cross-platform solution currently exists.

MapLibre empowers us to fulfill our company goals.

## Have you supported other FLOSS projects in the past?

Yes, we donate 1% of our yearly revenue to FLOSS projects that we use in our company. This money is partially used for bug bounties. The remainder is distributed on projects and foundations. Each year we have an discussion about the organizations and projects we want to support. That way we can give something back to the FLOSS community.

We have already supported the Mozilla Foundation, the Django project and MapLibre of course!

# What do you wish for MapLibre's future?

We are very happy that MapLibre maintains map rendering libraries for the web and mobile platforms. Without the excellent engineers behind MapLibre, all of this would not be possible. We hope that donations will help MapLibre to stay a sustainable project. MapLibre should become the main community regarding map rendering on the Web!

Definitely sweet! Popcorn should be served sweet!
