Isaac brings expertise in graphics programming into the MapLibre Organization which is a central skill to what we are doing.

[Meena Chandrasekar](/about/meena/) is MapLibreâ€™s new Head of Marketing & Fundraising. Meena will lead all external communication of MapLibre, manage relationships with existing sponsors, and build new partnerships and connections. Fundraising is vital to the success of MapLibre as we operate exclusively on donations and Meena is exactly the right person to spearhead this.
