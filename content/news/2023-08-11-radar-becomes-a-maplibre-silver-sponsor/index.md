Radar is joining the MapLibre Sponsorship Program as a Silver Sponsor.

[Tim Julien](https://github.com/tjulien), CTO at Radar, was so kind to share a few insights into Radar and its relationship to MapLibre below:

MapLibre: Radar is Location Infrastructure for mobile and web apps. What role does MapLibre play in your products?

Tim: Radar’s location SDKs run on hundreds of million devices across web and mobile platforms. Our customers have been searching for a cost effective all-in-one location stack, so this year we’ve launched [Radar Maps](https://radar.com/documentation/maps/maps) to complete our vision of “a location platform for every product and service”. MapLibre powers Radar Maps within that user base.

MapLibre: With your sponsorship of MapLibre you are directly supporting the open-source maps ecosystem. How did you decide to sponsor MapLibre?

Tim: With the momentum behind MapLibre over the past year it’s an exciting time for the open-source mapping community. Since we incorporated MapLibre into [Radar Maps](https://radar.com/documentation/maps/maps) it was only natural to sponsor the project to support core development.

MapLibre: Do Radar's products require some new features in the MapLibre toolkit which do not exist yet?

Tim: Not at the moment!

MapLibre is glad to have you and looks forward to a productive and sustainable common future!
