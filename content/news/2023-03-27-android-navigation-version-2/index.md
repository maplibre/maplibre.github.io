MapLibre Navigation Android is an open source navigation library which allows everyone to build a customized navigation experience on Android.
You can easily integrate a lot of different tiles, as you are used to from MapLibre Native.
You can integrate your own routing backend, OSRM and GraphHopper (using the `/navigate` endpoint) are easy to implement.
You can build your own navigation UI. An example implementation of such a custom implementation can be found in the [Kurviger App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kurviger.app).

The full changelog of this update is:

- Initial release of Navigation UI package.
- We adapted Navigation module (mostly `RouteFetcher`) to be aligned with the implementation we need in the Navigation-UI package.
- Move Style-Url, Routing-Url and Access-Token to NavigationSettings in sample app.
- Remove unused code (mostly Mapbox Speech Service related classes).
- Updated MapLibre version to v10.0.2.
- Incremented minSdk version from 15 to 21 to work same as maplibre implementation.
- Created custom classes for `GoogleLocationEngineImpl`, `Utils`, `LocationEngineProvider` which were removed from default implementation MapLibre to provide working with GSM location.
- Corrected resource calls due to renamed res files in maplibre (from `mapbox_` to `maplibre_`).
- Updated dependencies of used libs and build tools
- Removed AccessToken usage
- Fixed Jitpack Build
- Use the navigation options instead of constants in ToleranceUtils (used in the offroute detection), if you haven't modified rerouting values in the navigation options, nothing should change
