We are happy to announce that JawgMaps has joined the MapLibre Sponsorship Program and supports us as a Silver Sponsor!

The JawgMaps platform provides enterprise-grade mapping services built from both OpenSource and proprietary tools, as well as OpenStreetMap data. Far from simply being a map customizing tool, Jawg provides you with statistics that enable you to adapt your product according to the needs of your users.

Jones Magloire, CTO of Jawg Maps, says, quote, "We have been serving tiles to our customers since 2015, starting with Raster Tiles. In 2017, we introduced Vector Tiles through our style editor, the Jawg Lab, as we believed it was the future. That’s why in 2021, when MapLibre was launched, we chose to support the project and encourage our customers to migrate to MapLibre GL as the recommended library."

MapLibre is proud to have gained JawgMaps as a Silver Sponsor and we thank you for trusting us. Your support strengthens our community and makes MapLibre more sustainable. Great to have you!
