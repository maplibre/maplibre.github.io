Yasunori Kirimoto and Kanahiro Iguchi who are both [MapLibre Voting Members](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/blob/main/VOTING_MEMBERS.md) are organizing the User Group. The plan is to create online meetups and bring people together who are interested in MapLibre. They also have some nice MapLibre swag for you!
