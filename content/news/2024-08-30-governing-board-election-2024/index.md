The MapLibre Governing Board members serve for a one year term and at the end of August we hold the Board election with representatives of the community, the MapLibre Voting Members. Yesterday, on Thursday, Aug 29th, 2024, the election poll closed and the following people were elected to the Board:

- [Yuri Astrakhan](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/discussions/375#discussioncomment-10119547) (incumbent, Rivian)
- [Petr Pridal](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/discussions/375#discussioncomment-10352676) (incumbent, MapTiler)
- [Luke Seelenbinder](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/discussions/375#discussioncomment-10351649) (incumbent, Stadia Maps)
- [Birk Skyum](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/discussions/375#discussioncomment-10329544) (incumbent, independent)
- [Haowen You](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/discussions/375#discussioncomment-10233553) (new candidate, Amazon)

Congratulations to everyone who got elected!

We also would like to thank [Max Ammann](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/discussions/375#discussioncomment-10327772) for running as Board candidate. With 6 candidates and 5 Board seats, Max did not make it into the Board but in retrospect he was the person who gave the community a choice. It is great to see your dedication to MapLibre. Thank you for all your contributions, Max!

Harel Mazor served on the MapLibre Governing Board during the first two years of its existence. We would like to thank you, Harel, for all the volunteering work you did as a Board member and are glad that you keep supporting everyone in your role as Maintainer of MapLibre GL JS.

## New Voting Members

Prior to the election, the existing MapLibre Voting Members had the opportunity to nominate new Voting Members. The condition to become a Voting Member is that you contributed "in a non-trivial way" to MapLibre or your company financially supports MapLibre.

More than [20 people](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/issues?q=label%3Avoting-member-nomination+is%3Aclosed) became new MapLibre Voting Members in 2024. Thank you all for your contributions to MapLibre and showing your interest in the MapLibre Organization. You are all more than welcome to keep contributing and being involved!

## Election Statistics

We used an online voting tool called [OpaVote](https://opavote.com/) for the Governing Board election. With this tool, we sent emails to all Voting Members with unique links that allowed them to vote on a website during one week. The Voting Members had to rank all 6 candidates in order from 1 (most favorite) to 6 (least favorite). Once the poll was closed, the tool used the [Meek STV algorithm](https://blog.opavote.com/2017/04/meek-stv-explained.html) to determine 5 winners. Meek STV is a commonly used algorithm for elections with a comparatively small electorate.

- Emails sent (number of Voting Members): 124
- Emails rejected: 1
- Emails opt-out: 1
- Emails delivered: 122
- Voting page unique visits: 81
- Voted: 74
- Not voted: 50
- Election turnout: 59.7 percent

All anonymized ballots, as well as the Meek STV results can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/tree/main/2024-polls).

We are looking forward to a good year with the new MapLibre Governing Board!
