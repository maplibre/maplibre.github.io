With Ovidiu Voda starting today, we are proud to now have two people working as Maintainers on MapLibre Native. Please give Ovi a warm welcome!

Ovi is going to work together with Bart Louwers on Native and he is looking forward to meeting everyone involved in the project. Feel free to reach out to Ovi and say hi to him.

We plan to initially work together with Ovi for three months, January, February, March 2023, and then evaluate how we best proceed.

Ovi previously led Mapillary's Android team. It is a big honor for MapLibre to contract with a person who is as experienced as Ovi and we are looking forward to what the future will bring!
