To work on Bounties, follow this step-by-step guide:

1. We need your contact details including country of residence to make sure that we can send money to you from the US. For this, apply for the Developer role at https://maplibre.org/jobs.
   Note that everybody can apply and we welcome applications from both individuals and companies. If you plan to work on Bounties through a company, please indicate so in the “motivation” section of the application form.

1. We will review your application and add you to the <a href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/wiki/Developer-Role#current-role-holders-developer-pool">Developer pool</a> if you are accepted for the role. In the Developer pool, we will list your name publicly. Please only apply if this is fine for you.

1. Once you are in the Developer pool, you can look for Bounties. They are published as GitHub Issues with the tags “bounty S”, “bounty M”, or “bounty L” depending on the size of the Bounty. Here are all links to the Bounties in different repos: [MapLibre GL JS Bounties](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%F0%9F%92%B0+bounty+L%22%2C%22%F0%9F%92%B0+bounty+S%22%2C%22%F0%9F%92%B0+bounty+M%22+), [MapLibre GL Native Bounties](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%F0%9F%92%B0+bounty+L%22%2C%22%F0%9F%92%B0+bounty+S%22%2C%22%F0%9F%92%B0+bounty+M%22+).

1. If you find a Bounty and you would like to work on it, ask in the GitHub Issue if you can claim it. A maintainer will then assign the Issue to you and you can start working. Throughout your work, feel free to ask the maintainers for guidance.

1. Alternatively you can suggest Bounties yourself. For this, create a GitHub Issue with clear deliverables and ask a maintainer if they can assign a Bounty to your Issue. Please make sure that your ticket falls within a [cross-project direction approved for Bounties](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22bounty+direction%22).

1. Once you are done with the work, the maintainers will confirm that all deliverables were met in the GitHub Issue of the Bounty.

1. You create an invoice for MapLibre on OpenCollective for the Bounty you have completed. For this, submit an expense at https://opencollective.com/maplibre. Please include in the invoice a link to the GitHub Issue of the Bounty.

1. We approve your expense on OpenCollective and the money gets transferred to your account.
