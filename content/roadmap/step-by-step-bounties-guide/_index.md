To get started doing bounties, follow this step-by-step guide.

## 1. Join the Developer Pool

1. We need your contact details including country of residence to make sure that we can send money to you from the US. For this, <a href="https://maplibre.org/jobs">apply for the Developer role</a>. Note that everybody can apply and we welcome applications from both individuals and companies. If you plan to work on bounties through a company, please indicate so in the “motivation” section of the application form.

1. We will review your application and add you to the <a href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/wiki/Developer-Role#current-role-holders-developer-pool">Developer pool</a> if you are accepted for the role. In the Developer pool, we will list your name publicly. Please only apply if this is fine for you

## 2. Working on a Bounty

Once you are in the Developer pool, you can start doing bounties. There are three options:

- **Choosing an existing bounty**: Find an issue with a bounty for [MapLibre GL JS](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%F0%9F%92%B0+bounty+S%22%2C%22%F0%9F%92%B0+bounty+M%22%2C%22%F0%9F%92%B0+bounty+L%22%2C%22%F0%9F%92%B0+bounty+XL%22%2C%22%F0%9F%92%B0+bounty+XXL%22+) or <a href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%F0%9F%92%B0+bounty+S%22%2C%22%F0%9F%92%B0+bounty+M%22%2C%22%F0%9F%92%B0+bounty+L%22%2C%22%F0%9F%92%B0+bounty+XL%22%2C%22%F0%9F%92%B0+bounty+XXL%22+">MapLibre Native</a>. If you find a bounty you would like to do, ask in the GitHub issue if you can claim it. A maintainer will then assign the issue to you. Throughout your work, feel free to ask the maintainers for guidance.

- **Suggesting a bounty**: Alternatively, you can suggest things you would like to work on yourself. For this, create a GitHub issue with clear deliverables and ask a maintainer if they can assign a bounty to your issue. Please make sure that your ticket falls within a <a href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22bounty+direction%22">cross-project direction approved for bounties</a>.

- **Suggesting an epic**: Additionally, you can also suggest an _epic_, i.e., a series of tickets with a bounty for each ticket that together move the project forward in one of the bounty directions. You can suggest the size of the bounties on each ticket yourself, and a maintainer will confirm if the amount is adequate.

Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/wiki/Bounty-System#bounty-sizes">possible sizes of the bounties</a>.

## 3. Claiming a Bounty

1. Once the issue has been implemented, the maintainers will confirm that the deliverables were met in the GitHub issue of the bounty.

1. You create an invoice for MapLibre on OpenCollective for the bounty you have completed. For this, submit an expense at https://opencollective.com/maplibre. Please include in the invoice a link to the GitHub issue of the bounty.

1. Post a link to the invoice on the GitHub issue.

1. Every 16th of the month expenses will be approved on Open Collective. After this is done the money gets transferred to your account.
