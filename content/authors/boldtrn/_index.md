Hi, my name is Robin. I am the founder of [Kurviger](https://kurviger.de/) a motorcycle route planning and navigation app. I am passionate about maps, motorcycling, and open source. At MapLibre I help with maintaining the [Android navigation library](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-navigation-android).
