Open-source TypeScript library for publishing maps on your website.
Fast displaying of maps is possible thanks to GPU-accelerated vector tile rendering.

MapLibre GL JS originated as an open-source fork of _mapbox-gl-js_ and MapLibre GL JS v1 is fully compatible with Mapbox GL JS v1. This allows you to easily migrate existing Mapbox v1 solutions to MapLibre.

Starting with MapLibre GL JS v2, compatibility is not guaranteed anymore which gives us the freedom to take the library to new directions and lets people shape it more directly.
