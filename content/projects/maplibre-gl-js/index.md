Open-source TypeScript library for publishing maps on your websites.
Fast displaying of maps is possible thanks to GPU-accelerated vector tile rendering.

Originated as an open-source fork of _mapbox-gl-js_, the library is
intended to be a drop-in replacement for the Mapboxâ€™s version with
additional functionality.
