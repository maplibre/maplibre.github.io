Open-source SDK for Android and iOS allowing displaying maps inside of your
mobile applications, desktop application, or embedded devices.
This toolset grants fast maps displaying in iOS and Android apps using the
same GPU-based acceleration as the TypeScript version.

_MapLibre Native_ is an open source fork of _mapbox-gl-native_.

Starting is 2023, we plan to overhaul the library and complement the existing OpenGL rendering backend with a Metal rendering backend for fast and efficient rendering on iOS devices. The overhaul is a great opportunity for you to learn more about the library and get involved with the MapLibre community.

More information can be found in the following design proposals:

- [Rendering Modularization Proposal](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/pull/547/)
- [Metal Port Design Proposal](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/pull/580/)
