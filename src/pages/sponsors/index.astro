        <h2 class="mt-6">Why Your Support Matters</h2>
        <p>
          The MapLibre Sponsorship Program secures the continuity of the project
          and keeps the codebases healthy and up-to-date. Here is how funds are
          used:

                  Paid maintainers for MapLibre GL JS and MapLibre Native handle
                  infrastructure, pull request review, issue triage, user
                  support, and documentation.

        <!-- Who Should Sponsor -->
        <h2 class="mt-6">Who Should Sponsor?</h2>
        <p>Your organization should sponsor MapLibre if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your products are built on top of MapLibre</li>
          <li>Your customers use MapLibre</li>
          <li>You want to upstream new features</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By sponsoring, you share maintenance costs with others, ensure a
          sustainable path for the framework you depend on, and reduce the risk
          of having to fork and maintain a codebase of this complexity yourself.
          You also help avoid community fragmentation, making it easy for new
          users to adopt and migrate.

        <h2 class="mt-6">Advisory Council</h2>
        <p>
          The MapLibre Advisory Council is a quarterly forum where sponsors and
          the MapLibre Organization exchange feedback, discuss future
          engineering investments, forge collaborations, and align on a common
          roadmap. Members of the Governing Board are welcome to join. While the
          Council has no binding decision power, it strengthens the long-term
          stability of the project.

        <!-- In-Kind Contributions -->
        <h2 class="mt-6">In-Kind Contributions</h2>
        <p>
          Financial support is not the only way to help. Organizations and
          individuals can also contribute directly through:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Code contributions and developer hours</strong> — bug fixes,
            new features, and pull request review
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Infrastructure</strong> — CI/CD resources, hosting, or testing
            environments
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Documentation and translations</strong> — guides, examples, and
            localization
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Design and marketing</strong> — visual assets, outreach, and
            event support
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In-kind contributions are most effective when they address a
          documented project need, can be maintained or handed off without
          creating long-term dependency, and align with MapLibre's open-source
          governance. Check our
          <a href="/roadmap">Roadmap</a> and
          <a href="https://github.com/maplibre">GitHub repositories</a> for current
          priorities, or reach out at
          <a href="mailto:team@maplibre.org">team@maplibre.org</a>
          to discuss how you can contribute.
