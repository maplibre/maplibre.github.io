Today, we merged the new renderer for maplibre-rs. It is based on bevy. Thanks bevy-devs for your outstanding progress on developing a game engine in Rust! Thank you very much for making your work open-source!

This week we continued to work on the scientific publication around maplibre-rs. Checkout the previous weekly for more information.

From now on this news will only be posted monthly, as I will have significantly less time for maplibre-rs in the next 3 months.
