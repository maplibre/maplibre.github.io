## Vulkan

Vulkan is a modern graphics API which brings advantages such as improved performance, improved observability and better stability. Vulkan is poised to replace OpenGL ES eventually on Android. Starting 2026, new devices will only support OpenGL ES through a[ translation layer](https://developer.android.com/games/develop/vulkan/overview). Just like the [Metal backend](https://maplibre.org/news/2024-01-19-metal-support-for-maplibre-native-ios-is-here/) prepared MapLibre Native for the future on iOS, the Vulkan backend prepares the project for the future on Android.

## Thank You

The project was brought to fruition by a team of graphics engineers colloquially known as the MapLibre Native Development Team: _Alex Cristici_, _Adrian Cojocaru_, _Tim Sylvester_, _Marc Wilson_ and led by _Steve Gifford_. Adrian was brought on the team as Vulkan expert early this year, and he did the main development push for Vulkan. The [rendering modularization](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/blob/main/design-proposals/2022-10-27-rendering-modularization.md) effort of last year laid the ground work for being able to implement other rendering backends. Many thanks to everyone involved.

Another big thanks goes to AWS for sponsoring this project.

Lastly, thanks to everyone that tried out the pre-releases and gave us feedback!
