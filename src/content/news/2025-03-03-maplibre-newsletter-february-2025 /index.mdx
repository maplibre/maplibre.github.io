In this edition, we’re sharing key updates across MapLibre Native, GL JS, Flutter, and the MapLibre Tile Specification (MLT), along with details on upcoming community meetings.

A huge thank you to everyone who supports MapLibre through GitHub and OpenCollective platform! In 2023, we received $4,644.23, and in 2024, contributions grew by 24.3% to $5,772.77 USD. Your support plays a vital role in sustaining and expanding our open-source ecosystem—we truly appreciate it.

We’ve also published the Q4 2024 Financial Report, providing insights into our funding and expenditures. You can read the full report [here](https://maplibre.org/about/reports/Financial-Report-Q4-2024.pdf).

With that note of gratitude, here's the round-up from February 2025! Whether you’re a developer, contributor, or open-source enthusiast, there’s plenty to explore in this newsletter.

## MapLibre Native

- Implementation of the new [MapLibre Tiles format](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-tile-spec#maplibre-tiles-mlt) is in full swing. There is a [PR in the `maplibre/maplibre-tile-spec`](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-tile-spec/pull/441) repo with a C++ reader implementation and a [draft PR](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/pull/3246) for the intergration in MapLibre Native.

  Even though development has only recently started, this proof-of-concept is already able to use MLTs (MapLibre Tiles) as a source alongside [MVTs](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec).

- [MapLibre iOS 6.11.0](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/ios-v6.11.0) was released.

  - Custom Style Layers, allow drawing on the map using the Metal API. It can now be used from Swift. See [this article](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-native/ios/latest/documentation/maplibre-native-for-ios/customstylelayerexample) in the documentation.
    - In the upcoming MapLibre iOS 6.12.0 release we are exposing some low-level events for better observability, see [this article](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-native/ios/latest/documentation/maplibre-native-for-ios/observerexample).

- Custom Drawable Layers allow drawing on the map with in a platform-independent way. Currently you need to use C++ if you want to use custom drawable layers. This month [a PR](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/pull/3210) was merged that adds some additional functionality and improvements to custom drawable layer, among other things a way to upload (3D) geometries.

## Web

This was a bit of a short month so in this month we only released a single version: 5.1.1.
`addProtocol` showed again its power and a plugin was released to support arbitrary fonts loading using tinySDF: https://www.npmjs.com/package/maplibre-local-glyphs, thanks @spatialillusions
! This will hopefully pave the way to other font functionality that's coming in the near future.

## MapLibre Flutter

Version `0.2.1` of [flutter-maplibre](https://github.com/josxha/flutter-maplibre) got released this month. Key feature of this release is the possibility of synchonous controller calls on android due to the exciting release of [Flutter 3.29](https://medium.com/flutter/whats-new-in-flutter-3-29-f90c380c2317). This is a big milestone to seemlessly display and position Flutter widgets on top of the map. Check out the [changelog](https://github.com/josxha/flutter-maplibre/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#021) for all other improvements.

[Support for iOS](https://github.com/josxha/flutter-maplibre/issues/26) made progress as well with its completion hopefully in March.

## Martin Tile Server

We should have a MapLibre tile format news section, and in there put all the relevant news, i.e.

- @TimSylvester has been working on MLT decoder implementation in C++ - https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-tile-spec/pull/441
- @jjcfrancisco and @nyurik have published [Rust version](https://crates.io/crates/fastpfor) of FastPFOR algorithm - the foundation of the MLT format.
