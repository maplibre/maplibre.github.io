If you have ideas for new features which you would love to see from MapLibre, you can now share your idea
and tell us that we should allocate Bounties for it. Bounties are pre-defined cash prizes for development tasks.

Every donation from the MapLibre Sponsorship Program has a part which is reserved for Bounties and we
would like to hear from you in what direction we should take the project with the Bounties...

## Share Your Idea

To share your own idea, do this:

1. Go to the [Bounties overview page](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/discussions/categories/bounties-cross-project-directions)
2. Press "New discussion"
3. Use a catchy title
4. Put an image if you have one (maps people really like visuals...)
5. Describe the idea in a few sentences

## Voting

We would love to understand better what is important to you, and you have the opportunity to up-vote ideas.

To vote, you can simply go to the [Bounties overview](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/discussions/categories/bounties-cross-project-directions) and click on the up-arrow of the ideas that you like:
