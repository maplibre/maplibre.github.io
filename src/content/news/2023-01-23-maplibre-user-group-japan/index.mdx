Yasunori Kirimoto and Kanahiro Iguchi who are both <a href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/blob/main/VOTING_MEMBERS.md">MapLibre Voting Members</a> are organizing the User Group. The plan is to create online meetups and bring people together who are interested in MapLibre. They also have some nice MapLibre swag for you!
