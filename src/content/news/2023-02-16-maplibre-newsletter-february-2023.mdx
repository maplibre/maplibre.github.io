There is an ongoing discussion if a style editor should be maintained under the MapLibre umbrella. See <a href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/discussions/153#discussioncomment-4776796">style editor discussion</a>.

## Events

- On Jan 30th, 2023, about 20 people came together for the first MapLibre Switzerland meetup in Olten. After a short overview presentation by Oliver Wipfli, we had a discussion about what people need. Feature-state in Native, rendering of 3D buildings, and improving the style specification were discussed. After that we went for Pizza. Thanks Robin Schmid for hosting us in the SBB office and thanks everyone for coming!
- On Feb 1st, 2023, more than 40 people joined the first MapLibre User Group Japan online meeting. Thanks Yasunori Kirimoto and Kanahiro Iguchi for organizing this!

## MapLibre GL JS

In the last Technical Steering Committee meeting on Feb 8th, 2023, we had the pleasure to welcome some new faces, including people from OSM Americana and Felt.

There were some discussions around how to move the style specification forward and how the contribution process can be more stream-lined.
