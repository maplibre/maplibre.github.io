[maplibre-rs](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs) is an upcoming and cross-platform vector map renderer written in Rust. If you want to get in touch with the developers visit the [#maplibre:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#mapr:matrix.org) chat or join the MapLibre (#maplibre and #maplibre-rs) community within the OpenStreetMap Slack. You can get an invite [here](https://slack.openstreetmap.us).

## üì∞ News

If you haven't read the initial news then check it out [here](/news/2022-05-06-maplibre-rs-weekly).
In the past week we continued to work on our collaboration with the University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HES-SO/HEIG-VD), Switzerland.
The main focus of the past week was on documentation and redesigning the renderer and the structure of the maplibre-rs library.

In the past week, I extracted the render from [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/). After some discussions [on Github](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs/discussions/75), Slack and Matrix we concluded that writing a renderer specific to maps is the best option. In general, specialized renderers can be optimized better. By implementing a renderer ourselves, we also stay independent of other projects. For example, Bevy is a render engine (renderer + a lot more) for games. That means that features which are important for bevy are most likely not important for maplibre-rs and vice versa. For example, the Bevy renderer does not support a stencil.

Because I'm quite unexperienced in the world of 3D graphics, I dediced to base the renderer on some existing one. The best renderers in the Rust world are currently Bevy and rend3. After evaluating both renderers I decided to go with the Bevy one, because rend3 had usages of `unsafe. Both renderers are based around the idea of a [render graph](https://logins.github.io/graphics/2021/05/31/RenderGraphs.html).

## üè† Housekeeping

The following will summarizes what happened last week on GitHub.
