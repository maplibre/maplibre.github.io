**Komoot** joined the MapLibre Sponsorship Program as a Silver Sponsor. Welcome komoot, we are glad to have you in the MapLibre community! Read the [news announcement...](https://maplibre.org/news/2023-04-06-komoot-becomes-a-maplibre-silver-sponsor/)

We released version 2.0.0 of the **Android Navigation** library. Big thanks to Robin Boldt and everyone who helped with this! Read the [news announcement...](https://maplibre.org/news/2023-03-27-android-navigation-version-2/)

The **Metal Project Team** has now officially started to work on the MapLibre Native migration from OpenGL to Metal on Apple devices. Steve Gifford wrote a [blog post](https://www.wetdogweather.com/blog/maplibre-upgrade) about the role of WetDogWeather in this migration. Our goal is to get a Metal Beta release out by the end of 2023. Read more about it in our [news announcement...](https://maplibre.org/news/2023-03-23-metal-project-team-started/)

MapLibre is happy to host a new repository: `flutter-maplibre-gl`! This project provides MapLibre bindings for Flutter. [flutter-maplibre-gl](https://github.com/maplibre/flutter-maplibre-gl)

## MapLibre GL JS

#### Bounties ðŸ’°

Bounties completed since March 20th, 2023:

- Opacity fix for `setTerrain` by adding a warnonce when it detects that a user is using the same source for a hillshade and for 3D terrain [Opacity fix for setTerrain](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/issues/2035)
- Add `queryTerrainElevation` allows getting terrain elevation in meters at specific point ([#2264](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/pull/2264))

## MapLibre Style Specification

The MapLibre Style Specification has been moved out of MapLibre GL JS and lives now in its own repository: [maplibre-style-spec](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-style-spec)

Big thanks to Birk Skyum for bringing up the new documentation website for the style spec at [MapLibre Style Spec](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/)!

#### Debated design proposals:

- Support for `refreshTiles` per tile source [#61](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-style-spec/issues/61)
- Expanding `tileSources` bounds [#60](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-style-spec/issues/60)
- Add elevation to symbol layer [#62](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-style-spec/issues/62)
- Update `text-offset` to better support variable anchor placement [#112](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-style-spec/issues/112)

Since there are now two design proposals that expand the <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/tilejson-spec">TileJSON specification</a>, we plan to create a fork of TileJSON and maintain it in the MapLibre Organization.

<a href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-style-spec/issues/60">
  <Image src={tileBounds} alt="tile bounds" style="width:100%; height: auto;" />
</a>

<i>
  Some data sources like traffic have non-global coverage. To avoid loading
  empty tiles, we want to introduce more complex source tile bounds in the
  TileJSON specification.
