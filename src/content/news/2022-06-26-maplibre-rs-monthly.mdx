[maplibre-rs](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs) is an upcoming and cross-platform vector map renderer written in Rust. If you want to get in touch with the developers visit the [#maplibre:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#mapr:matrix.org) chat or join the MapLibre (#maplibre and #maplibre-rs) community within the OpenStreetMap Slack. You can get an invite [here](https://slack.openstreetmap.us).

## üì∞ News

This months we had quite a few first-time contributions! Let's hope this trend keeps up. The maplibre-rs team will try to supply enough high-quality issues.
Apart from that major progress in headless rendering and CI infrastructure has been done.

I'm happy to announce that [@ybiletskyi](https://github.com/ybiletskyi) and [@Quillasp](https://github.com/Quillasp) are checking out what's needed to get raster tile rendering working. [@ybiletskyi](https://github.com/ybiletskyi) resolved a limitation of wgpu in [#2781](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/2781). Looking forward to see how the project scales with new features!

The paper about maplibre-rs for FOSS4G is finished! Looking forward to meet all of you in August!
