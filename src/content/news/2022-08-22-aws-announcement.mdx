We are pleased to announce the Amazon Web Services (AWS) support for the MapLibre
Organization as a Platinum Sponsor. Thanks for your generous support and for all the trust you
put in us!

AWS is an active participant in the MapLibre Organization and community at large. We wanted
to know why AWS decided to support us, so we asked them a few questions:

## 1. How is AWS using MapLibre today?

MapLibre is in use across AWS by both our customers and several AWS services. It is Amazon
Location Service’s recommended map renderer and forms the basis of AWS Amplify Geo’s map
display and geocoding capabilities. We’ve been excited to see the project grow since it
launched in 2020 and look forward to continuing our work with the MapLibre Organization.

## 2. Why is the support and growth of the MapLibre community important to AWS and its customers?

Many AWS customers already use MapLibre, so this is an opportunity to help support ongoing
innovation and maintenance on their behalf. It also allows us to ensure that MapLibre works well
with AWS services like Amazon Location Service and AWS Amplify Geo by partnering with the
community.

Overall, supporting the MapLibre Organization is about meeting our customers where they are
and helping to nurture a thriving open source community. More flexibility in map rendering
engines leads to more experimentation by customers, which helps drive innovation across the
industry.
