Happy New Year, MapLibre Community! We are thrilled to share big updates for MapLibre Native (including Vulkan support), the official launch of MapLibre GL JS Version 5.0, new features in Martin Tile Server, and more.

In January we will hold a MapLibre Eastern Call again to better connect with contributors around the world.

Let‚Äôs dive in!

## MapLibre Native

- MapLibre Android [11.7.0](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/android-v11.7.0) and [11.7.1](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/android-v11.7.1) were released. These versions mark the first-ever releases with Vulkan support. Check out the detailed announcement on [MapLibre Android Vulkan Support](https://maplibre.org/news/2024-12-12-maplibre-android-vulkan/).
- The latest version of MapLibre iOS [6.9.0](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/ios-v6.9.0) is here.

### Kotlin Multiplatform

Exciting news for developers interested in [**Kotlin Multiplatform**](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html): [Sargun Vohra](https://github.com/sargunv), with input from [Tobias Zwick](https://github.com/westnordost), has released [MapLibre for Compose](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-compose#maplibre-for-compose)!

The library integrates MapLibre iOS and MapLibre Android and is open to contributions. Experiments that add desktop support as well as support for the web (by intergrating with MapLibre GL JS) are underway.

Originally released late November, the library is now at v0.4.0. Get started here:

- üìÇ Repository: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-compose)
- üìñ Documentation: [Explore Docs](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-compose/)

Here‚Äôs a sneak peek of MapLibre for Compose in action:

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "center",
    gap: "20px",
  }}
>
  <Image
    src={maplibre_compose_android}
    style={{
      maxWidth: "200px",
      width: "100%",
      height: "auto",
      display: "inline-block",
    }}
    alt="MapLibre Compose - Android demo"
  />
  <Image
    src={maplibre_compose_ios}
    style={{
      maxWidth: "200px",
      width: "100%",
      height: "auto",
      display: "inline-block",
    }}
    alt="MapLibre Compose - iOS demo"
  />
</div>
<br></br>

## MapLibre GL JS

We‚Äôre thrilled to announce the official release of [MapLibre GL JS Version 5.0](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/releases/tag/v5.0.0)! üåè

This major release, shaped by feedback and several pre-releases (including [5.0.0-pre.9](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/releases/tag/v5.0.0-pre.9), [5.0.0-pre.10](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/releases/tag/v5.0.0-pre.10) released in December 2024), introduces globe rendering mode, providing a more immersive experience.
It doesn't mean it's perfect, nothing is, we will continue to improve it, fix bugs and add new features, but we feel it is ready to see the world and get a wider audience.

Try it out and share your thoughts!

## Martin

Martin Tile Server [v0.15.0](https://github.com/maplibre/martin/issues/1632) will have been released‚Ñ¢:

While there are a [lot of improvements](https://github.com/maplibre/martin/releases/tag/v0.15.0), here are the stand out features:

- **COG Support**: Basic [`cog` (Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF) support](https://maplibre.org/martin/sources-cog-files.html) was added as a data source. This allows to effectively serve raster tiles similar to mbtiles raster mode and pmtiles raster mode. See [our docs](https://maplibre.org/martin/sources-cog-files.html) for further context.
- **Web UI framework**: We have laid the foundation for a web-UI, thoug it is still in early development. Get a glimpse of our vision for the UI by visiting this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/maplibre/martin/issues/1120).
- **SDF sprites**: `SDF` sprites can now be generated via a separate API route. This allows to color sprites in `maplibre-gl`/`maplibre-native` based on map data and have crispier sprites.
  Limitations include:

  - Single-color support only.
  - Background customization limited to blurred borders.

    Learn more in [the Martin docs](https://maplibre.org/martin/sources-sprites.html). Here‚Äôs an example sprite from [NavigaTUM](https://nav.tum.de):

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <Image
    src={martin_sdf}
    style={{
      maxWidth: "600px",
      width: "100%",
      height: "auto",
      display: "inline-block",
    }}
    alt="Martin Tile Server - sprites demo"
  />
</div>

## Flutter MapLibre

Started in September 2024, the Flutter maplibre package was created to provide modern Flutter bindings for MapLibre Native and MapLibre GL JS and a seamless integration into the Flutter ecosystem. Currently, supported platforms are Android and Web, while the iOS implementation is on the way and, as of right now, about halfway done (see [#26](https://github.com/josxha/flutter-maplibre/issues/26)).

Key features include its integration into the Flutter state management system and widget tree, direct interoperability using FFI and JNI, and platform-invariant customizable user interface. A more in depth comparison with `flutter-maplibre-gl` and other similar packages can be found in the `maplibre` docs: [flutter-maplibre.pages.dev/compare/](https://flutter-maplibre.pages.dev/compare/).

The package already receives a couple of hundred downloads each month, and its goal is to become a full alternative to flutter-maplibre-gl by the end of Q1 2025.
