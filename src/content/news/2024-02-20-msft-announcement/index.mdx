The Silver tier [donation](https://opencollective.com/maplibre/contributions/733415) of USD 80,000 will be used to 20 percent for development of new features and to 80 percent for general maintenance of the MapLibre codebases and project coordination.

From the very beginning Microsoft was instrumental in building the MapLibre Organization and with the membership in the MapLibre Sponsorship Program, Microsoft lays out the foundation for a sustainable common future.

Microsoft uses MapLibre GL JS in both consumer and enterprise map products.

Bing Maps deploys MapLibre GL JS in production, a feat which was only possible thanks to performance improvements that were contributed to MapLibre by Bing Maps Engineers.

Azure Maps serves business customers all around the world with high-quality mapping products which are built on top of MapLibre GL JS.

We look forward to all the great contributions from Microsoft and are honored to have Microsoft as a Sponsor!
