## üì± MapLibre Native

- The C++ MapLibre Tiles decoder, written by Tim Sylvester, [got merged](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-tile-spec/pull/441) this month. He also worked on the [Java _encoder_](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-tile-spec/tree/main/java), the [integration into MapLibre Native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/pull/3246) and a new [`encoding`](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-style-spec/pull/1251) style spec property for vector sources. After some last-minute optimizations this month, the MapLibre Tile Spec itself is now considered [stable](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-tile-spec/pull/560).

  Long story short, all lights are on green you will be able to use the next-generation tile format with MapLibre Native soon (before the end of the year?). Stay tuned!

- [Birk Skyum](https://maplibre.org/about/birk-skyum/) has contributed a [WebGPU backend](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/pull/3838) for MapLibre Native. We already have dedicated backends for Vulkan, Metal and OpenGL, but the advantage of the new WebGPU backend is that it makes Native more portable.

  Previously we [demonstrated](https://birkskyum-maplibre-native-wasm.pages.dev/qt-for-webassembly/webgl1-from-opengl2-legacy-renderer-qt6-9-1/) that MapLibre Native can run in the browser as WebAssembly by compiling the OpenGL backend to WebGL1/2 but that approach is heavy. The WebGPU backend will be significantly more performant.

  Additionally, the WebGPU backend can simplify cross-platform development with frameworks like Compose Multiplatform and Flutter, by offering a single backend that can be used for all desktop/mobile/web targets.

- We have enabled [immutable releases](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-08-26-releases-now-support-immutability-in-public-preview/). A GitHub feature that makes it impossible to tamper with release assets.

- üßë‚Äçüíª Join the MapLibre Native Hackathon!

  Hack on the MapLibre Native codebase with guidance from expert contributors. Build plugins, fix bugs, add features,anything goes!

  The hackathon kicks off on Oct 27, 2025, includes office hours on Nov 3 & 10, and wraps up with Demo Day on Nov 12 at the MapLibre Native monthly meeting.

  [Sign up here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbJe7VohJmbtK83T0s5C49WYxkmKlr424ZPJFrWWwk5LFxVA/viewform) to learn, experiment, and shape the future of the project

## üåê MapLibre GL JS

September was a busy month with four new releases:[5.7.1](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/releases/tag/v5.7.1), [5.7.2](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/releases/tag/v5.7.2), [5.7.3](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/releases/tag/v5.7.3) and [5.8.0](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/releases/tag/v5.8.0).

The latest one, 5.8.0, stands out, as it introduces data-driven styling for [line-dasharray](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/layers/#line-dasharray), a long-awaited feature and [the most upvoted issue](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/issues/1235) in our tracker. Thanks Lucas (@lucaswoj) for this great contribution! We are super excited someone in the community decided to work on it.

Other improvements this month include:

- Fixes for raster tile fading, with more enhancements coming soon thanks to Ryan ([@wayofthefuture](https://github.com/wayofthefuture)).
- Numerous fixes to [`global-state`](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/expressions/#global-state), primarily led by [@melitele](https://github.com/melitele), significantly ironing out most of the related issues.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Maputnik

This month has been a very productive one for [our small style editor](https://maputnik.github.io/).

Maputnik had recently gained the status of a ["supported project"](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/blob/main/PROJECT_TIERS.md#supported-project) in MapLibre, so if there's something you'd like to work on and get paid this is now possible.

We have been working hard to update all the libraries to their latest versions, including React to version 19. This upgrade required replacing outdated libraries that are no longer maintained and fixing issues across the existing codebase.

We also added support for more recent changes to the [MapLibre Style Spec](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/), such as [globe projection](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/examples/display-a-globe-with-a-vector-map/) and [`global-state`](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/expressions/#global-state), along with several lesser-known fields introduced in recent years.

This marks a strong start to Maputnik‚Äôs new status, and we believe that the more stable and widely used it becomes, the more features it will receive from this great community.
