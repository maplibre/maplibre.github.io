MapLibre exists because organizations and individuals believe in open-source mapping infrastructure. Today we want to thank the sponsors who make that possible, share what we accomplished together in 2025, and explain what we need now.

TL;DR 🫵 we need YOU.

So first...

## 🙏 Thank You to Our Sponsors

MapLibre's Sponsorship Program is the backbone of our financial stability. We are grateful to the companies that have committed to supporting the project:

- 🥇 **Gold:** Microsoft
- 🥈 **Silver:** AWS, MIERUNE, Komoot, Jawg Maps, Radar, MapMe, MapTiler

In 2025, Microsoft elevated to Gold Sponsor and MapTiler joined as Silver Sponsor. Every renewal and new commitment strengthens our foundation.

We are also delighted with the 80+ individuals who have supported MapLibre through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/maplibre) and [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/maplibre). These recurring donations reflect the commitment and integrity of our community, and help fund infrastructure and maintenance work that is hard to prioritize otherwise.

Your contributions fund paid maintainers for MapLibre GL JS and MapLibre Native (infrastructure, PR review, issue triage, documentation), a coordinator (fundraising, newsletter, financial reporting), and the Development Fund for new features. Full details are on our updated [Sponsors page](/sponsors).

## 🚀 What We Accomplished Together

MapLibre is [awesome](https://github.com/maplibre/awesome-maplibre), and 2025 was a landmark year. Here are some highlights your support helped make real:

- 🌐 **MapLibre GL JS v5** — globe rendering, hillshade, and data-driven line-dasharray (one of our most requested features).
- ⚙️ **Martin v1.0** — a production-ready tile server after eight years, with Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF support, a web UI, and MLT decoding.
- 📱 **MapLibre Native** — Vulkan on Android, a WebGPU backend, and expanded reach to Compose Multiplatform and Flutter.
- 🧩 **MapLibre Tiles (MLT)** — stable specification with decoders in C++, TypeScript, and Java, and support in GL JS and Native.
- 🎨 **Maputnik** elevated to a supported project.
- 👥 **Community** has 141 Voting Members and representation at FOSS4G, FOSDEM, State of the Map, and conferences across four continents.

## 💡 What We Need Next

We want to broaden and deepen our sources of funding, as our current funding does not cover full-time maintainers for both GL JS and Native. This limits how responsive and proactive we can be in building new features and responding to community requests.

Also, a small sponsor base means risk: if even one major sponsor exits, it creates a real gap.

We are doing what we can to address this — applying for grants, and doing more outreach — but we need your help. Please spread the word, and consider what you might contribute in 2026:

- 💎 **[Become a sponsor](/sponsors)** — corporate tiers from Diamond to Silver. [Contact us](mailto:team@maplibre.org) to discuss.
- 💸 **[Donate as an individual](https://opencollective.com/maplibre)** — even small recurring contributions sustain the project. Also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/maplibre).
- 🤝 **Contribute in kind** — code, developer hours, grant writing, infrastructure, documentation, design, or marketing. [Reach out](mailto:team@maplibre.org) if you or your organization can help.

## 💬 We Want to Hear From You
