MapLibre exists because organizations and individuals believe open source mapping infrastructure should be freely available to everyone. Today we want to thank the sponsors who have made that possible, share where we stand financially, and explain how you can help us take the next step.

## Thank You to Our Sponsors

MapLibre's Sponsorship Program has been the backbone of our financial stability. We are grateful to the companies that have committed to supporting the project:

- **Gold:** Microsoft
- **Silver:** AWS, MIERUNE, Komoot, Jawg Maps, Radar, MapMe, MapTiler

Their sustained contributions fund the paid maintainers and coordinator who keep MapLibre GL JS, MapLibre Native, and the broader ecosystem healthy day after day. Without them, the project would depend entirely on volunteer availability — and as any long-running open source project knows, that is not sustainable.

We also want to recognize the 80+ individuals who have supported MapLibre through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/maplibre) and [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/maplibre). These recurring donations show the integrity and diversity of our community, and help fund the kind of infrastructure and maintenance work that is hard to prioritize otherwise.

## What Sponsorship Funds

If you have ever wondered where your money goes, here is the short version:

- **Maintenance** — Paid maintainers handle infrastructure, pull request review, issue triage, user support, and documentation for our core libraries.
- **Coordination** — A paid coordinator manages fundraising, recruitment, the monthly newsletter, social media, and financial reporting.
- **Development Fund** — A percentage of each sponsorship tier goes directly toward new features and technical improvements.

Full details, including tier benefits and pricing, are now available inline on our updated [Sponsors page](/sponsors).

## What We Need to Take Things Further

MapLibre has seen significant industry adoption, but our current funding level still does not cover full-time maintainers for both MapLibre GL JS and MapLibre Native. The comparatively small number of sponsors also exposes the project to risk: if even one major sponsor exits, it creates a real gap.

We are taking steps to broaden our funding base, for instance by applying for open source and nonprofit grants. We need your help. Please spread the word, and consider what you might contribute in 2026:

- **GitHub Sponsors** — We now accept sponsorships through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/maplibre), making it easy for developers and organizations already on GitHub to set up recurring contributions.
- **In-kind contributions** — Not every contribution needs to be financial. We welcome code contributions, developer hours, grant writing, infrastructure, documentation, design, and marketing support. If your organization can help, [reach out](mailto:team@maplibre.org).
- **Updated Sponsors page** — We have redesigned [maplibre.org/sponsors](/sponsors) to surface all sponsorship information inline — tiers, benefits, what funds pay for — so potential sponsors no longer need to download a PDF to understand the program.

## How You Can Participate

**If you represent an organization** that builds on MapLibre, consider joining the Sponsorship Program. You share maintenance costs, gain a seat at the Advisory Council, and ensure the framework your products depend on stays healthy. [Contact us](mailto:team@maplibre.org) to discuss options.

**If you are an individual developer**, even a small monthly contribution makes a difference. Set up a recurring donation on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/maplibre) or [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/maplibre).

**If you can contribute time**, check the [Roadmap](/roadmap) and our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/maplibre) for current priorities. Code contributions, documentation improvements, and translations are always welcome.

MapLibre's mission is to keep the best open-source mapping tools free for everyone. We can't do it without your support.
