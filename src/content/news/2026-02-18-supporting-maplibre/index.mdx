MapLibre exists because organizations and individuals believe open source mapping infrastructure should be freely available to everyone. Today we want to thank the sponsors who make that possible, share what we accomplished together in 2025, and explain how you can help us take the next step.

## Thank You

MapLibre's Sponsorship Program is the backbone of our financial stability. We are grateful to the companies that have committed to supporting the project:

- **Gold:** Microsoft
- **Silver:** AWS, MIERUNE, Komoot, Jawg Maps, Radar, MapMe, MapTiler

In 2025, Microsoft elevated to Gold Sponsor and MapTiler joined as Silver Sponsor. Every renewal and new commitment strengthens our foundation.

We also want to recognize the 80+ individuals who have supported MapLibre through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/maplibre) and [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/maplibre). These recurring donations show the integrity and diversity of our community, and help fund infrastructure and maintenance work that is hard to prioritize otherwise.

Your contributions fund paid maintainers for MapLibre GL JS and MapLibre Native (infrastructure, PR review, issue triage, documentation), a coordinator (fundraising, newsletter, financial reporting), and the Development Fund for new features. Full details are on our updated [Sponsors page](/sponsors).

## What We Accomplished Together

2025 was a landmark year. Here are some highlights your support helped make real:

- **MapLibre GL JS v5** — globe rendering, hillshade, and data-driven line-dasharray (one of our most requested features).
- **Martin v1.0** — a production-ready tile server after eight years, with Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF support, a web UI, and MLT decoding.
- **MapLibre Native** — Vulkan on Android, a WebGPU backend, and expanded reach to Compose Multiplatform and Flutter.
- **MapLibre Tiles (MLT)** — stable specification with decoders in C++, TypeScript, and Java, plus experimental GL JS support.
- **Maputnik** elevated to a supported project with paid development.
- **141 Voting Members** and representation at FOSS4G Global, FOSDEM, State of the Map, and conferences across four continents.

## What We Need Next

Our current funding does not cover full-time maintainers for both GL JS and Native. Since we must always prioritize performance and security, this limits how responsive and proactive we can be in building new features and responding to community requests.
A small sponsor base means risk: if even one major sponsor exits, it creates a real gap. We are doing what we can to address this by broadening our funding base — applying for grants, and doing more outreach.

We need your help. Please spread the word, and consider what you might contribute in 2026:

- **[Become a sponsor](/sponsors)** — corporate tiers from Diamond to Silver. For more details visit our [Sponsors page](/sponsors) or[contact us](mailto:team@maplibre.org) to discuss.
- **[Donate as an individual](https://opencollective.com/maplibre)** — even small recurring contributions sustain the project. Also available on [Github](https://github.com/sponsors/maplibre).
- **Contribute in kind** — code, developer hours, grant writing, infrastructure, documentation, design, or marketing. [Reach out](mailto:team@maplibre.org) if you or your organization can help.

## We Want to Hear From You

If you already sponsor MapLibre, what motivated you? What do you value most about this project and community? What would you like to see in 2026? Your feedback shapes our priorities — write to [team@maplibre.org](mailto:team@maplibre.org) or raise it in the Advisory Council.

And finally, if you are not yet involved, there are many ways to start:

- **Slack** — Join at [slack.openstreetmap.us](https://slack.openstreetmap.us), then find us in `#maplibre`.
- **Roadmap discussions** — The [Technical Steering Committee](/community) meets monthly (second Wednesday). Open to everyone.
- **Newsletter** — Our [monthly newsletter](/news) covers releases, community highlights, and events.

MapLibre's mission is to keep the best open-source mapping tools free for everyone. We can't do it without you.
