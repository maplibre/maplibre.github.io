Below, the CalTopo team shares more about why they chose to support MapLibre and how it fits into their product roadmap.

## What motivated CalTopo to support MapLibre?

MapLibre is a core part of how CalTopo works and we rely on it every day to deliver the mapping experience our users expect. Supporting MapLibre is about investing in an organization that we depend on and believe in. When the libraries continue to grow and improve, it helps us build better tools for our community and ensures the long-term stability of the mapping technology behind our apps.

## How does MapLibre fit into your product and technical roadmap?

MapLibre plays a central role in how people experience CalTopo. In our mobile app, it’s the map engine that displays all of our layers, routes, and user data. On the web, [MapLibre powers our 3D maps](https://caltopo.com/map.html#ll=38.80547,-98.41553&z=5&b=mbt), making it possible for users to explore terrain in a more intuitive, visual way. As we continue to invest in performance and expand our 3D capabilities, MapLibre remains an important part of how we bring those ideas to life.

## What do open-source mapping tools mean for your community?

Open-source mapping tools make it possible for us to stay focused on what matters most to our users. By building on reliable, community-driven libraries, we're able to move faster, keep costs down, and put more effort into solving real planning and navigation challenges. That ultimately means a better product for our users and access to powerful tools without unnecessary barriers.

## Is there a message you’d like to share with MapLibre contributors and users?

We're thankful for the work and care that goes into the libraries and MapLibre organization. The time and effort contributed by the community have a direct impact on the tools our users rely on every day. We're proud to support this work and excited to be part of an open mapping ecosystem that continues to grow and improve through collaboration.
