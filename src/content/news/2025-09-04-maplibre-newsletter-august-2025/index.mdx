August was a busy month for the MapLibre community. From welcoming new Voting Members as part of the Governing Board election process to new releases across key projects, there is plenty of progress to celebrate.

First and foremost, we extend our gratitude to [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) for continuing, and increasing their sponsorship for MapLibre this year. Their contribution has nearly doubled, elevating them to Gold Sponsor and providing vital support for the sustainability of our projects.

## üó≥Ô∏è New Voting Members

As part of the [2025 Governing Board election process](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/issues/447), we held [a round of nominations](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/issues/446) to expand the Voting Members group. Voting Members are responsible for electing the Governing Board and voting on changes to the [MapLibre Charter](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/blob/main/CHARTER.md).

We‚Äôre pleased to welcome [19 new Voting Members](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/issues/446#issuecomment-3224717918) this August and look forward to their contributions in shaping MapLibre‚Äôs future.

You can checkout [the full list of 141 Voting Members in our GitHub documentation](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/blob/main/VOTING_MEMBERS.md).

## üì± MapLibre Native

- **Want to help test MapLibre Android?** In addition to our existing continuous integration tests we are taking a crowdsourced approach to testing. We now make releases of the [MapLibre Android TestApp](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases?q=android-testapp&expanded=true). If you want to help, simply download the apk and install it on a Android device you have laying around. Next, open the 'Long running Maps' activity and let it run for up to 72 hours! Crashes are logged to our [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) so that MapLibre developers can investigate and fix issues.

- MapLibre Android 11 was released well over a year ago, but some people are still on MapLibre Android 10.x.x. We made a [release](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/android-v10.3.5) for this previous major release to bring 16 KB pages support since Google will [require](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/prepare-play-apps-for-devices-with-16kb-page-size.html) it for apps on the Google Play store starting November 1.

- Two minor regular releases [MapLibre Android 11.13.1](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/android-v11.13.1) and [MapLibre iOS 6.18.1](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/ios-v6.18.1).

- [MapLibre Node.js](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/node-v6.2.0) also had a release that fixes a problem where it would not render more than 32 frames.

## üåê MapLibre GL JS

Version [5.6.2](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/releases/tag/v5.6.2) and [5.7.0](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/releases/tag/v5.7.0) were released this month.

These releases focused mainly on some bugs fixes, especially related to the recently added [`global-state`](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/API/classes/Map/#setglobalstateproperty) which probably still needs more ironing out. There was also an addition of the [`coveringTiles`](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/API/classes/Map/#coveringtiles) method to the public API after it was buried a bit too deep when adding the globe support in version 5.

Huge thanks to all contributors who helped make these improvements possible, we appreciate your efforts and look forward to more contributions!

## üß© MapLibre Tile Format

Work continues on the [maplibre-tile-spec](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-tile-spec) project as we are finalizing the specification for the 1.0 release next month. Additionally we are also preparing the Java based MVT to MLT converter for release.

Last-minute comments are still possible in [this thread](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-tile-spec/issues/519). Contributions and comments are highly valued!

## üéâ Slint SDK Onboarding for MapLibre Native

We‚Äôre excited to share the onboarding of a new Slint SDK for MapLibre Native, made by [@yuiseki](https://github.com/yuiseki).

- [maplibre-native-slint GitHub repository](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native-slint)
- [Onboarding Discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/issues/474)

This project provides a Slint-based integration for MapLibre Native, allowing MapLibre Native rendering to be embedded into Slint-based native GUI applications. For information on platform support, please [checkout the documentation in the project repository](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native-slint?tab=readme-ov-file#platform-support-matrix).

## üåç Ecosystem Spotlight: Sprite Sheet Benchmarks

OSM contributor `pnorman` recently [benchmarked three tools](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/pnorman/diary/407303) for generating sprite sheets: spreet (Rust), @basemaps/sprites, and sprite-one.

These tools are often used when building MapLibre styles. Results show spreet produces smaller, more efficient PNGs, especially after optimization.
