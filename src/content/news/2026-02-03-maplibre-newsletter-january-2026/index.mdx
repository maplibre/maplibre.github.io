## 📱 MapLibre Native

- We've published the test app for iOS on TestFlight!

  If you have a spare iPhone lying around, please enroll and run the 'long running test' made by [Adrian Cojocaru](https://github.com/adrian-cojocaru). Any crashes are automatically reported to our Sentry project and will be available for MapLibre developers to investigate[^1]. Testflight link: https://testflight.apple.com/join/h81pYA1M

[^1]: Note: crash reports may include some privacy-sensitive data such as IP addresses (see [privacy policy](https://maplibre.org/privacy-policy-ios-testapp/)).

- [Nathan Olson](https://github.com/NathanMOlson) added camera roll support to MapLibre Native ([#3011](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/pull/3011)). This feature is now available on both MapLibre iOS and MapLibre Android.

- Nathan also is working on a distance-based level-of-detail(LOD) implementation in [#4057](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/pull/4057). This is the same algorithm that is used for MapLibre GL JS. If you (also) have an aviation related use case for MapLibre Native we would love to hear from you.

- Releases this month:
  - MapLibre Node.js [6.3.0](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/node-v6.3.0)
  - MapLibre Android [12.3.0](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/android-v12.3.0), [12.3.1](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/android-v12.3.1)
  - MapLibre iOS [6.22.0](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/ios-v6.22.0), [6.22.1](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/ios-v6.22.1)

## 🌐 MapLibre GL JS

Versions [5.16](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/releases/tag/v5.16.0) and [5.17](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/releases/tag/v5.17.0) were released this month.
We also integrated the [`geojson-vt`](https://github.com/maplibre/geojson-vt) version that was recently onboarded into the MapLibre organization, which should facilitate faster GeoJSON updates in the near future.

We are looking to improve GeoJSON serialization, including addressing limitations related to nested properties. We'd love to get community feedback on the following PR:
https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/pull/6992

Once this PR is merged and GeoJSON serialization is improved, it will pave the way for releasing version 6 as this will be breaking. Version 6 will also include additional breaking changes that we've gathered over the past year, which are described in the following issue:

- https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/issues/6427

Any feedback is very welcome.

We would like to thank this month's contributors, every contribution helps make the library better for everyone who uses it. THANK YOU! 🙌

## 🧩 MapLibre Tile

This month we [officially announced](https://maplibre.org/news/2026-01-23-mlt-release/) MapLibre Tile!

[Tim Sylvester](https://github.com/TimSylvester) is working on adding PMTiles support to the Java Encoder CLI ([#798](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-tile-spec/pull/798)). The Java CLI tools can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-tile-spec/releases?q=java&expanded=true).
We have added coverage checking to the Java encoder/decoder. At the [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/github/maplibre/maplibre-tile-spec) page you can see that Rust and Java have some catching up to do to reach the coverage number of the TypeScript decoder.

We have a monthly community call to discuss MLT developments, if you would like an invite, send a message to team@maplibre.org

## ⚙️ Martin

We’ve released [Martin 1.3.0](https://github.com/maplibre/martin/releases/tag/martin-v1.3.0), bringing improvements to logging, font handling, routing, and tile formats - plus several performance and UX fixes.

Highlights include:

- **More flexible logging:**
  Martin now uses tracing instead of log, enabling better instrumentation and configurable log output via RUST_LOG_FORMAT. Supported formats include compact (default), json, full, bare, and pretty.
- **Improved glyph support beyond [`U+FFFF`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_block):**
  Fonts with characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (e.g. emoji, historic scripts, or private-use glyphs) are now handled correctly.
  We also removed FontSources.masks, reducing memory usage and startup time.

  Since not everyone is likely aware of what `U+FFFF` means:
  - `U+0000` - `U+FFFF` is Basic Multilingual Plane, which covers characters for almost all modern languages
  - `U+10000` - `U+3347F` covers minor characters such as historic scripts and emojis
  - `U+E0000` - `U+E01EF` is for tags and variation selectors
  - `U+F0000` - `U+10FFFF` is for private use (i.e. can be assigned arbitrary custom characters without worrying about possible conflict with the future standards)

- **Native subpath support:**
  A new `route_prefix` config option and `--route-prefix` CLI flag allow Martin to serve from a subpath without requiring reverse-proxy URL rewriting.
- **MLT decoding support**
  Martin now supports the MapLibre Tiles Specification (MLT), allowing MLT-based tiles to be served directly. Learn more in our blog post:
  https://maplibre.org/news/2026-01-23-mlt-release/
- Human-readable time estimates in martin-cp progress output
- PostgreSQL materialized view support and improved table metadata
