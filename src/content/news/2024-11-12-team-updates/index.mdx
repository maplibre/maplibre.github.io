We’d like to share a recent update regarding our [team](https://maplibre.org/about/) at MapLibre. Meena, who has been our Head of Marketing and Fundraising, has transitioned out of her role. We’re grateful for her efforts in fostering connections within our community and with our sponsors. We wish her well in her future endeavors.

Our commitment to the MapLibre community and our open-source mission remains strong. We’re dedicated to ensuring that our sponsorship program, community engagement and core project developments continue seamlessly. In the coming weeks, our team will be actively working to support these areas while we work on a long-term plan for MapLibre’s outreach efforts and sponsorship program.

Your support, contributions and enthusiasm are what makes this community so impactful. Please reach out with any questions or feedback.
