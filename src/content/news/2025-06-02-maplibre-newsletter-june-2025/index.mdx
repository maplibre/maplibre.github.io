Welcome to the May edition of the MapLibre newsletter!

This month's updates range from seamless Cloud Optimised GeoTIFF support in GL JS to fresh releases for Martin Tile Server and native SDKs. We are also thrilled to welcome Marc Wilson to our team, as a Graphics Engineer and can't wait to see all the great things he will contribute to the community.

A special thanks to [Mierune](https://www.mierune.co.jp/) for renewing their sponsorship for 2025!. Now in its fourth consecutive year, their support has played a vital role in sustaining MapLibre's growth and development.
