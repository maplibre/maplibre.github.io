The Q4 2024 Governing Board Meeting, held on November 19, focused on assessing MapLibre’s financial health, community initiatives, and operational improvements. With over $1 million raised to date, MapLibre’s financial stability is bolstered by contributions from key sponsors and smaller wins that sustain momentum. For a detailed financial summary, you can refer to the [Q3 2024 Financial Report](http://maplibre.org/about/reports/Financial-Report-Q4-2023.pdf).

The meeting also emphasized community engagement. Support was approved for the Japan User Group Meetup, including resources like venue sponsorship, stickers, and badges. To enhance consistency in community support, the board is developing regional event guidelines, reinforcing MapLibre’s mission to foster grassroots collaboration within the open-source mapping space.
    
Operational updates included optimizing costs for tools and software. Proposals were made for mid-month progress updates from team members to enhance transparency and align priorities across teams and stakeholders. These efforts aim to ensure that ongoing work remains clear and actionable.

The MapLibre RS project, initially aimed at creating a unified Rust-based rendering solution, was also a key discussion point. The project faces challenges with engagement and alignment with MapLibre’s ecosystem. The board is exploring a modular integration approach for Rust components within existing libraries while continuing conversations with the project lead to identify collaboration opportunities.

Looking forward, the organization plans to establish remote work-friendly HR policies and diversify sponsorship efforts. Increased transparency and collaboration will be central to these efforts, ensuring MapLibre continues to thrive in the open-source mapping community.
