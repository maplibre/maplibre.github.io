Three new people have joined the MapLibre Team. Please give them a warm welcome!

[Isaac Besora](about/isaac/) has joined MapLibre as Graphics Engineer. His initial focus will be improvements in MapLibre GL JS in particular in the areas of Terrain 3D and the new Globe feature. Isaac brings expertise in graphics programming into the MapLibre Organization which is a central skill to what we are doing.

[Meena Chandrasekar](about/meena/) is MapLibre’s new Head of Marketing & Fundraising. Meena will lead all external communication of MapLibre, manage relationships with existing sponsors, and build new partnerships and connections. Fundraising is vital to the success of MapLibre as we operate exclusively on donations and Meena is exactly the right person to spearhead this.

She will coordinate work with maintainers, the community, and contributors, while also managing internal processes such as meeting coordination, financial oversight, and hiring. She will focus on aligning roadmaps and gathering feedback from the community to ensure successful collaboration and outcomes.

It is great to have the three of you on our team. We wish you in the name of the MapLibre Governing Board a good start and are looking forward to your contributions!
