[maplibre-rs](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs) is an experimental & portable vector map renderer written in Rust. If you want to get in touch with the developers, visit the [#maplibre:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#mapr:matrix.org) chat or our Slack at [osmus.slack.com](https://osmus.slack.com/).

Together with researches from the University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HES-SO/HEIG-VD) in Switzerland, we published the first scientific paper about maplibre-rs. It is available as open-access [here](https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-XLVIII-4-W1-2022-35-2022).
The paper includes a comprehensive review of existing open-source map renderers and their portability. We describe the architecture of maplibre-rs and uncover the challenges we encountered.
