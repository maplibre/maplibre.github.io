We would like to thank our first sponsor [Mierune](https://www.mierune.co.jp/) for their continued trust in MapLibre.

#### MapLibre Innovation Lab

Many real-world applications have been built with MapLibre. As suggested [here](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/discussions/242) it is about bringing the Community together. Implementing new ideas is what will make MapLibre thrive further. We want to recognize all of your efforts, collectively, and so decided to expand on the idea of the MapLibre Innovation Lab - stay tuned.

#### OGC Sprint

To engage with the Community in person, MapLibre was represented at the [OGC Code Sprint](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/camptocamp-sa_the-ogc-code-sprint-at-camptocamp-activity-7062726780234682368-9Dq_) in April. We mingled with fellow geospatial developers at the beautiful offices of the host [CamptoCamp](https://www.camptocamp.org/). We enjoyed a family-like gathering with Lake Geneva and its surrounding mountains only a stone's throw away. As of [MapLibre GL JS](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js), we tested a pitch-dependent field of view, which can be used to let 3D buildings 'pop out' as you change the pitch. Additionally, we experimented to make the depth buffer accessible for end users, which can be used to implement effects, such as fog, in the near future. Regarding [MapLibre Native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native), some work on CI was done: from now on, a bot leaves comments with a link of the results on PRs when render tests have run.

#### Bounty Program ðŸ’°

We would like to remind you about our news in April:

"The amounts allocated to [Bounty Directions](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22bounty+direction%22) are pre-approved budgets. If an individual or a company would like to work on a Bounty Direction but requires more funding, they can make a request to the Governing Board to increase the budget of a Bounty Direction."

In the upcoming days, you will find a step-by-step guide on what to hand in for a "Budget Increase". On top of that, we are excited to add "Bounty Direction Suggestion". Again, both can be applied for by companies as well as individuals. All details can be found in our [wiki](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/wiki/Bounty-System). We are very much looking forward to your input.

- Parallelize test workflow by splitting up jobs: [#2482](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/issues/2482)
- Update WebGL types in vertex buffer and uniform binding: [#2515](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/issues/2515)

#### Contributions

Most notable contributions since April 14th, 2023:

- Lazy load default style properties on demand to improve loading performance and reduce memory usage: [#2476](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/pull/2476)
- Remove support for `hsl` CSS color in a format that does not comply with the CSS color specification. Colors defined in the following format **will no longer work**: `hsl(110, 0.7, 0.055)`. Instead **it is recommended** to use the percentage format: `hsl(110, 70%, 5.5%)`. See the PR: [#2376](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/pull/2376)
- Remove "mapbox-gl-supported" package from API. If needed, please reference it directly instead of going through MapLibre: ([#2451](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/pull/2451))
- Remove WebGL1 support: ([#2512](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/pull/2512))
