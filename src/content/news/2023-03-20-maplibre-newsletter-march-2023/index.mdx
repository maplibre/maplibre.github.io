# MapLibre Newsletter - March 2023

## General

#### Bounty Program

We invite you to share feedback on what features and improvements in MapLibre GL JS and MapLibre Native would be helpful for you. Tell us what you need and vote for the things which are most important to you following these [feedback instructions](https://maplibre.org/news/2023-03-13-second-call-for-bounties/).

The MapLibre Governing Board will take your feedback and decide how to allocate Bounty resources on roadmap projects on April 4th, 2023.

Several Bounties are up for takers now. If you would like to work on Bounties, have a look at our updated [step-by-step Bounties guide](https://maplibre.org/roadmap/step-by-step-bounties-guide/).

We encourage individuals and companies to propose epics, i.e., a series of tickets which together move MapLibre forward in one of the Bounty directions. You are free to suggest the Bounty size on each ticket yourself and propose splitting all the available resources of a Bounty direction on the tickets of your epic. A maintainer will consider your proposal and confirm the Bounty sizes.

We are proud to have paid out the first two Bounties to the developers Aidan Hendrickson and Victor Tempranova, see our <a href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/wiki/Developer-Role#current-role-holders-developer-pool">developer pool</a> for an overview.
