The highlight of this month is the landmark release of Martin v1.0, a major milestone for the project. We also bring updates across MapLibre Native and GL JS, a new video export plugin from the community, and information on upcoming community calls.

## 🧩 Martin

🎉 After 8 years in development, [Martin v1.0](https://maplibre.org/martin/introduction.html) is here! 🎉

We are thrilled to announce [the official release of Martin v1.0](https://github.com/maplibre/martin/releases/tag/martin-v1.0.0). Since joining MapLibre in 2022, Martin has evolved from a simple tile server supporting a single PostgreSQL connection into the fastest, feature-rich, open-source tile server available today.

This incredible progress is thanks to [over 80 contributors](https://github.com/maplibre/martin/graphs/contributors) who have expanded Martin's capabilities to include:

- **Multiple Data Sources**: Support for multiple PostgreSQL, PMTiles, and MBTiles backends.
- **MapLibre Ecosystem**: Full support for fonts, sprites, and styles.
- **Powerful Features**: A rich web UI, plus tools for tile generation and MBTiles manipulation.
- **Developer Flexibility**: The ability to use Martin as a library for building custom tile-serving solutions.

A special thanks to Stepan Kuzmin, the original author, and to key contributors Yuri Astrakhan, Frank Elsinga, and Lucas, along with everyone else who made this project a success!

## 📱 MapLibre Native

- Please help us test the new MapLibre Android pre-release, [`v12.3.0-pre0`](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/android-v12.3.0-pre0) (available on Maven Central). Two features need testing:
  - icon placement with pitched maps (especially if you use `icon-offset`) and
  - camera animations.

  Since we don't have a large QA team, we rely on the community to help ensure enhancements don't inadvertently break existing apps. Please report back, even if everything worked as expected.

- We made a new release of the [MapLibre Android test app](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/android-testapp-b30207bcb92396afc77c7456a68706adeecca50c). If you have an Android device lying around, you can help us improve the stability of MapLibre Android by installing this app and starting the "long running test" activity. Any crashes will be automatically reported to MapLibre developers.
- The test app helped us find [and fix](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/pull/3962) a long-standing bug of the Vulkan backend that we were not able to reproduce before. This was one of the last [blockers](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/issues/3387) for one of our users that wanted to use[the Vulkan build](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.maplibre.gl/android-sdk-vulkan) of MapLibre Android.

- Releases
  - MapLibre Android [12.2.0](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/android-v12.2.0), [12.1.3](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/android-v12.1.3), [12.1.2](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/android-v12.1.2), [12.1.1](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/android-v12.1.1), [12.1.0](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/android-v12.1.0)

  - MapLibre iOS [6.21.1](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/ios-v6.21.1), [6.21.0](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/ios-v6.21.0), [6.20.1](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/ios-v6.20.1), [6.20.0](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/ios-v6.20.0), [6.18.0-patch0](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/ios-v6.18.0-patch0)

- We also recommend reading this detailed community post by Ahmed, on [MapLibre performance on Android Auto](https://helw.net/2025/11/16/maplibre-on-android-auto/).

## 🌐 MapLibre GL JS

We have released two major versions this month: [v5.12](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/releases/tag/v5.12.0) and [v5.13](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/releases/tag/v5.13.0).
The main feature that was added as part of these versions is support for MLT (MapLibre Tiles)!

**Experimental Tile Slicing**

- We've introduced an experimental feature for slicing vector tiles on the fly, this solves some precision issues with labels and improves performance for high zoom levels.
- We will probably make this feature non experimental and define a different default in the next breaking change version (version 6, for which the timeline is yet to be defined), so it would be great if you could give it a try, check out the [`experimentalZoomLevelsToOverscale`](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/API/type-aliases/MapOptions/#experimentalzoomlevelstooverscale) flag.

**GeoJSON Optimizations & Font Updates**

- There were a lot of performance improvements to the GeoJSON source along side addressing a context restore blank map issue.
- In these versions there was also a leap forward in term of font support by [adding uncommon Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese characters](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/pull/6640) along side allowing `glyph` to be removed and use the browser native text rendering capabilities, which can improve support for rendering text in all kind of languages.
- Styles are no longer strictly tied to server-side glyph PBFs: they can render text using local or Web fonts whenever PBFs are unavailable. This enhances [CJK text rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_characters), supporting bold/italic variants and resolving Japanese character misalignment.

## 🎥 MapLibre GL Video Export Plugin

Brice Person has made [the first release](https://github.com/bjperson/maplibre-gl-video-export/releases/tag/v0.1.0) of an open-source plugin for MapLibre GL JS that enables video export with animated camera movements.

**What it does:**

- Exports videos (WebM/MP4) directly from MapLibre GL maps
- 28 preset animations (orbit, drone shots, terrain-aware paths, etc.)
- Waypoints system for defining points of interest
- WebM VP9 recommended (royalty-free, hardware-accelerated)

**Technical approach:**
Uses MapLibre GL JS v5.11.0+ time control API (`setNow()`) for deterministic frame-by-frame rendering, ensuring smooth exports without screen recording artifacts.

**Resource Links:**

- GitHub: https://github.com/bjperson/maplibre-gl-video-export
- Live demo: https://bjperson.github.io/maplibre-gl-video-export/
- npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/maplibre-gl-video-export

Feedback and contributions welcome!
