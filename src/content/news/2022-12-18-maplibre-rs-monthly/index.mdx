[maplibre-rs](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs) is an upcoming and cross-platform vector map renderer written in Rust. If you want to get in touch with the developers, visit the [#maplibre:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#mapr:matrix.org) chat or join the MapLibre (#maplibre and #maplibre-rs) community within the OpenStreetMap Slack. You can get an invitation [here](https://slack.openstreetmap.us/).

## üì∞ News

Technically, this is not a "monthly" as I did not find the time in the past months to regularly write these.
A lot has happened in the past months, though!

At least three major features and a few quality-of-developer-life features are cooking and are soon ready for testing.
For better debugging I integrated [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) into maplibre-rs. This should make it easy to display statistics like the current FPS or selected feature on the map. I could also imagine that a style editor in the style of [Maputnik](https://maputnik.github.io/) could be feasible.

Apart from egui, I also added a visualizing red border around tiles. This helped to improve the data loading performance of the renderer, as it became obvious which data loaded too slow.

  />

In late summer, [@Drabble](https://github.com/Drabble) already started working
on a proof-of-concept for extruded 3D buildings. The work required several
rebases over the months, but it survived and looks stunning! As per-feature
rendering is currently missing, all buildings have the same height right now. I
hope to change that in the near future. I noticed that design changes are
usually accompanied by multiple concrete problems. As we integrate more features
which are dependent on feature properties (building height, color properties,
etc.) the required design changes will be uncovered.

  />

In parallel [@Quillasp](https://github.com/Quillasp) worked on adding raster
tile support to maplibre-rs. It already works on native platforms (Android, iOS,
Linux, Windows) and in browsers. The decoding of the images is done using
WebWorkers. In the future, the browser should be tasked with the decoding jobs.

    style="display: block; margin: auto; max-width: 600px; width: 100%; height: auto;"
  />

Last but not least, I ported the SDF font rendering from the maps-rs prototype by [Luke Seelenbinder](https://github.com/lseelenbinder).
On the second try, it worked quite perfectly. Currently, there is no collision detection in place, which means that labels overlap while zooming in and out. Collision detection on its own is an interesting problem. On the OSM Slack we discussed whether this could be implemented on the GPU.
Current ideas for that are documented in a deck.gl [GitHub issue](https://github.com/visgl/deck.gl/issues/7374).

All the above features are not yet merged into the main branch of maplibre-rs as further design changes need to happen.
For example, the management of GPU resources is very verbose right now. Additions of GPU resources and requires changes in some core
engine `struct`. To mitigate this, further abstractions need to be invented.
After those design changes and resolving all discussions in the PRs we can merge in the features.

Apart from those new features, [kim pham](https://github.com/kimpham54) is currently working on parsing the MapLibre style specification, including its expressions.
Based on this work, the plan is that we generate statistics about the most frequently used style specification features.
This way we can create issues for all the missing features and prioritize them according to their usage.

Finally, I want to mention that maplibre-rs has now an RFC process described [here](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-rs/docs/book/rfc/0001-rfc-process.html). Based on that, I wrote an RFC about how data is exchanged between WebWorkers and the main thread [here](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs/pull/223). I think this is a great way to document progress. Let's see how that process will be used in the future!
