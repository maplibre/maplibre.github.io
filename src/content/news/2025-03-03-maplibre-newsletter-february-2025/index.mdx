We’re excited to share key updates across MapLibre Native, GL JS, Flutter, and the MapLibre Tile Specification (MLT), along with details on upcoming community meetings.

A huge thank you to everyone who supports MapLibre through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/maplibre) and [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/maplibre) platforms 🎉. Through these channels, we received $4,644.23 in 2023, and in 2024, contributions grew by 24.3% to $5,772.77 USD. Your support is essential in sustaining and expanding our open-source ecosystem - we truly appreciate it!

We’ve also published the Q4 2024 Financial Report, providing insights into our funding and expenditures. You can read the full report [here](https://maplibre.org/about/reports/Financial-Report-Q4-2024.pdf).

With that note of gratitude, here’s the February 2025 round-up.

## MapLibre Native

- Implementation of the new [MapLibre Tiles format](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-tile-spec#maplibre-tiles-mlt) is in full swing. There is a [PR in the `maplibre/maplibre-tile-spec`](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-tile-spec/pull/441) repo with a C++ reader implementation and a [draft PR](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/pull/3246) for the intergration into MapLibre Native.

  Even though development has only recently started, this proof-of-concept can already use MLTs (MapLibre Tiles) as a source alongside [MVTs](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec).

- [MapLibre iOS 6.11.0](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases/tag/ios-v6.11.0) is now available.

  - Custom Style Layers, allow drawing directly on the map using the Metal API with full Swift compatibility. Learn more in [this guide](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-native/ios/latest/documentation/maplibre-native-for-ios/customstylelayerexample).

- Looking ahead, the upcoming MapLibre iOS 6.12.0 release will expose some low-level events for better observability. More details can be found in [this article](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-native/ios/latest/documentation/maplibre-native-for-ios/observerexample).
- Custom Drawable Layers allow drawing on the map in a platform-independent way. Currently C++ is required to implement these layers. This month [a significant PR](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/pull/3210) was merged, introducing several imporvements, including:

  - enhanced functionality and improvements to custom drawable layer,
  - support for uploading 3D geometries, expanding rendering possibilities.

- [@frankkienl](https://github.com/frankkienl) from Flitsmeister has created a sample app demonstrating how to integrate MapLibre with Android Auto (and Automotive). This is a fantastic starting point for developers looking to explore automotive applications. Check out the repository here: [MapLibre Android Auto Sample](https://github.com/maplibre/MapLibre-Android-Auto-Sample).

## Web

February was a shorter month, but we still managed to roll out [MapLibre GL JS 5.1.1](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/releases/tag/v5.1.1) with key improvemens.

One notable highlight is the powerful `addProtocol` feature which enabled the release of a new plugin for loading arbitrary fonts using tinySDF:Check out [maplibre-local-glyphs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/maplibre-local-glyphs), developed by [@spatialillusions](https://github.com/spatialillusions) - a big thanks to their contribution!
This will hopefully pave the way to other font functionality that's coming in the near future. Stay tuned for further developments 🗺️.

## MapLibre Flutter

Version `0.2.1` of [flutter-maplibre](https://github.com/josxha/flutter-maplibre) got released this month. Key feature of this release is the possibility of synchonous controller calls on android due to the exciting release of [Flutter 3.29](https://medium.com/flutter/whats-new-in-flutter-3-29-f90c380c2317). This is a big milestone to seamlessly display and position Flutter widgets on top of the map. Check out the [changelog](https://github.com/josxha/flutter-maplibre/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#021) for the full list of improvements.

Work is also [progressing on iOS support](https://github.com/josxha/flutter-maplibre/issues/26), with completion expected by March 2025. Stay tuned!

## Martin Tile Format (MLT)

Exciting progress continues on the MapLibre Tile (MLT) format!

- **C++ MLT Decoder Implementation:** As mentioned before, [@TimSylvester](http://github.com/TimSylvester) has been actively working on a C++ decoder implementation for MLT. Checkout the ongoing work in [this PR](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-tile-spec/pull/441).
- **Rust based FastPFOR algorithm:** [@jjcfrancisco](http://github.com/jjcfrancisco) and [@nyurik](http://github.com/nyurik) have published a [Rust implementation](https://crates.io/crates/fastpfor) of the FastPFOR algorithm - which serves as the foundation of the MLT format.

A dedicated meeting for MLT development updates takes place every second Monday of the month at **3:15 PM UTC**. The next meeting is scheduled for **March 10, 2025**.

For ongoing updates, discussions, and collaboration, follow the **_#maplibre-tile-format_** Slack channel.

## 🌟 Community Spotlight: Mapping Historical New York with Vector Beeswarm Dot Density

The team at Stamen has introduced a fascinating mapping project using [maplibre-gl-js](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/), that visualizes historical New York using Vector Beeswarm Dot Density techniques. This approach beautifully showcases how data can be represented in a spatially meaningful and visually engaging way.
