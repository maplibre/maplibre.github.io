# MapLibre Newsletter - October 2024

We’re delighted to begin the October newsletter with a gracious and hearty Thank You to Meta for their unwavering support as a sponsor of MapLibre in 2024! We look forward to what is to come.

## MapLibre GL JS

We have released versions 5.0.0-pre.2, 5.0.0-pre.3 and 5.0.0-pre.4 this month.
One interesting feature that was recently added was the support for pitch larger than 90 degrees.

Here's an interesting situation that should be possible now:

    src={pitchlarger90degrees}
    alt="pitchlarger90degrees"
    style="width:100%; height: auto;"
  />
</a>
<br />
<br />

An interesting read on how this works can be found [here](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/blob/49d7fc96ad883b4e1042fe305cd0c0a16ccd9732/developer-guides/center-point.md).

We have introduced some breaking changes in these versions as was planned for version 5, so make sure to take a look at the changelog for more details.
There are still open issues with globe and other improvements we plan to add as part of this major release. Stay tuned!
See the [initial post](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/issues/3834) in the following issue to see the current status.

Overall we are progressing well and ironing out the globe feature.

## MapLibre Native

- Development of the Vulkan backend continued this month. We also ran another benchmark on AWS Device Farm, using even more device types this time. One conclusion you may draw from the [results](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/issues/2787#issuecomment-2432251912) is that Vulkan will offer a solid performance boost on modern devices. We're still validating these results. Stay tuned for an Android official release following later this year!
- Kaushal Kumar Singh rewrote the Android build config from Groovy to the more modern Kotlin in [#2902](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/pull/2902).
- Support for [`text-variable-anchor-offset`](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/layers/#text-variable-anchor-offset) has been merged ([#2921](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/pull/2921)). This feature is one of the features that Microsoft championed to be added to MapLibre GL JS, and now ported to MapLibre Native. We're happy with this contribution and are excited about Microsoft adopting MapLibre Native.
- MapLibre iOS [6.7.1 and 6.8.0](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases?q=ios&expanded=true) were released.
- MapLibre Android [11.5.1](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases?q=android-v11&expanded=true) was released.
- We also made two releases for [MapLibre Android v10](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases?q=android-v10&expanded=true) with some backports.

## Flutter
