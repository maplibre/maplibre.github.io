I believe we have a true chance for greatness with MapLibre.
As an Open Source promoter I believe in transparency and giving back
to the community what's rightfully theirs. Moving this project forward to
new technologies and new markets will be my main focus, making sure we
harness the power of the community by constantly updating our technology
stack and encoureging the community to contibute to the codebase.

In the day I work as a group leader in Dell Technologies and at night I'm
working on an open source hobby project called Israel Hiking Map
(co-founder) which is a small navigation app that uses Capacitor and thus
maplibre-gl-js to allow outdoor activities in Israel (hiking, biking, 4wd
driving, running etc...).

The contribution that started my journey in MapLibre was the addition of the
"addProtocol" method which opened up a world of opportunities to extend
maplibre like never before.

I've pushed forward the typescript migration along with the modernization of
the maplibre-gl-js stack, and helped with the 3D terrain and globe effort.

I generally enjoy participating in open source projects from the development
side of things and you probably know me from the annoying code review
comments I leave when you open a PR ðŸ˜Š.
