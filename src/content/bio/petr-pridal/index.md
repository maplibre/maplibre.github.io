My name is [Petr Pridal](https://maplibre.org/about/petr/), known as Klokan. I am co-founder of MapLibre, founder of OpenMapTiles, EPSG.io, author of GDAL2Tiles, architect of OldMapsOnline.org, contributor to open-source cartography on multiple fronts and projects, entrepreneur and CEO of MapTiler.com.

I am keen to offer my services to the MapLibre project and community again - as self-nominee for the governing board in 2025, because I strongly believe in the viability of open-source components for developers.

In the upcoming year, I want to help to push forward:

- [MapLibre Globe visualization](https://labs.maptiler.com/showcase/globe/) as production ready functionality for everyone (huge thanks @windycom @kubapelc already!)
  [![maplibre-globe](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/896961e5-a3fe-4a06-8e85-b3a981450c49)](https://labs.maptiler.com/showcase/globe/)

- Kick-off new [WebGPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGPU) renderer in TypeScript - to benefit from GPU accelerated processing of label collisions, data parsing & handling, transformations, improved font rendering, well-structured web workers, and prepare the map library for the integration of accelerated AI inference in the future. Let's gain more computational boost on modern hardware, which is closer to Vulkan and Metal instead of decades old OpenGL - while working on web-first code, but keep in sync with mobile and backend platforms
- Ensure amazing benefits of growing [MLT - MapLibre Tile format](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-tile-spec) becomes reality in production, but does not slow down stable GL JS - with the biggest optimizations to be made in the new WebGPU renderer
- Support further [performance boosts](https://labs.maptiler.com/sdk-benchmarks/) for MapLibre to build the fastest rendering map library out there

Please vote for me, so I can continue to contribute with improvement of processes and governance of the project - while helping to shape the future with strategical insights from industry and with my executive experience.

I have a degree in Computer Science, I have been coding myself for years, I also have extensive practical experience in management as well as education in board governance from IMD in Switzerland.

In the past, I was fighting on the board of MapLibre for:

- clear processes - hiring + documented roles & responsibilities (see subpages at [wiki](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/wiki))
- measurable goals aligned to [the project strategy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F5abpGx8VlVse4SHGwxgRRY1wQ29i-0_/view)
- transparent accounting (have a look yourself at https://opencollective.com/maplibre#category-BUDGET)
- clear [sponsorship offer](https://maplibre.org/sponsors/Slide-Deck-MapLibre-Sponsorship-Program.pdf) leading to raising money, allowing employment of maintainers in this open-source project
- trademarks - I donated the MapLibre EU trademark to the organization
- focus on becoming "the best rendering library" out there with innovation and clear roadmap

In previous years me and my team helped with setting up of this project, branding and identity of the project, we contributed in code on the initial version of Native, pushed initial announcements and assisted on many other fronts.

Let’s bring the MapLibre project to the next level - together :-)
