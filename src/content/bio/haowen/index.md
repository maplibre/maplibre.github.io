First of all, I want to express my sincere gratitude for the trust you placed in me during the 2025 term. Your support has enabled me to serve this community, and it has been one of the most fulfilling experiences I have ever had (while the role did demand more time and energy than I initially anticipated :grin:).

The past year has shown me the power and impact of our community when we all work together. We've achieved remarkable milestones that demonstrate MapLibre's influence in the geospatial technology landscape. For example, we have witnessed significant growth in adoption, with Amazon's last-mile logistics network being a notable addition to our user base. It's humbling to know that every Amazon delivery driver navigating their routes to deliver packages in your neighborhood is now using an application powered by MapLibre. We were also fortunate to have welcomed Microsoft as our newest Gold tier sponsor, joining Amazon and Meta in their commitment to MapLibre's future. Project-wise, our own tile spec MLT has shown its potential and is gaining traction to become the next standard for vector tiles. Our map serving project Martin has reached almost 3K stars organically. Strategic projects like Maputnik have also joined the MapLibre family, further enriching our ecosystem.

These achievements are not possible without some key individuals' hard work. At the same time, I view them as testaments to our community's collective strength. They reinforce my belief in MapLibre's potential and motivate me to continue to devote myself to supporting our community's growth and success.

On the on the governing board, I will continue my role as a bridge between MapLibre and major corporate adopters and sponsors. I will continue my commitment to connecting common interests, facilitating the exchange of ideas, and helping navigate diverging interests when they arise. I will drive for further growth in adoptions, contributions, and sponsorships to ensure MapLibre's long-term sustainability and success.

I'm honored to continue serving our community for another term. I believe together, we will build on our momentum and achieve even more in the coming year.
