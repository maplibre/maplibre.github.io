As a passionate advocate for open-source mapping software, I'm committed to driving MapLibre's mission forward.

# Past achievements

- After the license change, I proposed community to get together under `MapLibre` name, co-founded our organization, set up OpenCollective and its finances, did the initial re-branding and CI automation of the code

# This year's achievements

- Promote MapLibre at 5+ conferences, conducting workshops and lectures
- Grew MapLibre's Martin project to become the fastest tile server in the world, and gathering over 9 **new** contributors in the last release cycle alone.
- Continue to lead the new tile format efforts (MLT)
- Built Rust integration for MapLibre native
- Numerous engagements with the community at conferences
- Attend almost all zoom calls to keep up to date on all MapLibre developments and help coordinate all new developments

### My Mission Statement

I believe MapLibre should offer a complete mapping software stack -- "from bits to pixels": given data, the stack should offer a clear path to convert it into tiles, serve tiles to the world, visualize them with MapLibre web / native / rs, and offer extra functionality with plugins (like navigation), as well as style editing and other tooling. The list goes on.

Yes, but what about next year? I believe MapLibre must have three fundamental goals:

- Grow developer community
- Maintain and improve existing code
- Research next-generation stack with latest technology (WebGPU, faster tiles, multi-platform, ...)

All three goals are important - without the community we won't be able to maintain a vast codebase. Without investment into the next generation technology, we will quickly become irrelevant.

# A little more about me

- Volunteer Wikipedia core developer since 2005, implemented API and bot frameworks. Later worked for the foundation building Maps and data viz.
- Built Sophox OSM Sparql index and other OSM tools and libraries
- Contribute heavily to the Rust ecosystem, including the compiler/libraries
- Former principal engineer at Elastic (ElasticSearch), now working at Rivian (EV cars need good maps!)
