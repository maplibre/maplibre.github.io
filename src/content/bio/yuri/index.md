As a passionate advocate for open-source mapping software, I'm committed to driving MapLibre's mission forward.

# Past achievements

# This year's achievements
* Promote MapLibre at 5+ conferences, conducting workshops and lectures
* Grew MapLibre's Martin project to become the fastest tile server in the world, and gathering over 9 **new** contributors in the last release cycle alone.
* Continue to lead the new tile format efforts (MLT)
* Built Rust integration for MapLibre native
* Numerous engagements with the community at conferences
* Attend almost all zoom calls to keep up to date on all MapLibre developments and help coordinate all new developments

# Financial Disclosure
* From the time of inception, MapLibre has always been my volunteer project, without any financial benefits
* I do not accept any financial compensation from MapLibre apart from the conference travel reimbursements
* I successfully advocated for MapLibre adaption at Rivian Automotive, my current employer
