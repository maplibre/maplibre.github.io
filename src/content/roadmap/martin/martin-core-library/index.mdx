title: Martin Core Library
heroImage: "./image.png"
project: [ martin-tile-server ]
status: released
released: September 2025
---

Previously, our code was usable as a library.
To publish a v1.0 release of martin, we had to decouple the release cycle of our internal code (now `martin-core`) and the public tile server `martin`.
`martin-core` is a modular Rust library enabling Martins functionality to be embedded in other rust applications.
This empowers future embedding tile serving in web applications, building custom GIS tools, and rapid prototyping of geospatial services.

Key features:

- Embeddable tile serving
- Plugin system for custom sources
- Full async/await support
