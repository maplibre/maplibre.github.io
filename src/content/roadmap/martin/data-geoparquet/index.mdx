High-performance vector tile generation from cloud-native GeoParquet datasets.

GeoParquet combines columnar storage efficiency with geospatial capabilities, enabling Martin to serve tiles from massive datasets in modern data lakes.
Leverages Apache Arrow for zero-copy processing and supports partitioned datasets in cloud storage.

Key features:

- Direct cloud storage access (S3, GCS, Azure)
- Columnar data processing with predicate pushdown
- Memory-efficient streaming for petabyte-scale data

Ideal for Earth observation data, government geodata repositories, and analytics-driven geospatial workflows.
