- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry support for request flow analysis
- **Dashboards**: Pre-built Grafana templates for ops and business metrics

Key metrics tracked:

- Request rate, latency, and error rates
- Cache hit ratios and tile generation times
- Database connection pool and query performance
- Geographic usage patterns and popular datasets
