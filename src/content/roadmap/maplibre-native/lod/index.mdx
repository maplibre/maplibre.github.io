Level-of-detail (LOD) controls allow control over what zoom level is rendered for tiles that are further away. This is especially important for navigation use cases where the camera pitch can cause many tiles to be visible.

Implemented in [#2958](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/pull/2958).
