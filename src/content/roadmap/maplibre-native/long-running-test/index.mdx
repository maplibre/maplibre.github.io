Some of our users run MapLibre Native for many hours, sometimes days on end. To ensure stability, we wanted to develop a long running test. We are distributing this test so that everyone can run it with hardware they have laying around.

Implementation Android in [#3512](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/pull/3512). See the [latest releases](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/releases?q=android-testapp&expanded=true) on GitHub. 

A similar test for iOS will be available [soon](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/pull/3592).

After a vote by the developers, this ‘long running test’ is was officially called Desert Bus, named after a game from the 90’s where you had to drive a bus from Arizona to Nevada (an exciting 8 hour playthrough can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LtiHla1dNg)).
