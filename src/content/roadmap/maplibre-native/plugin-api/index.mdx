We are experimenting with various ways to add plugins for extending MapLibre Native.

[Plugin Layers](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-native/ios/latest/documentation/maplibre-native-for-ios/pluginlayers) allow custom rendering to intergrate with custom style layers (as of October 2025, only available for iOS).

See [#3703](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/pull/3703) for other suggested plugin APIs.

Meta developed a cross-platform plugin API that allows extending MapLibre Native with plugins written in C++. They have pledged to upstream this work.
