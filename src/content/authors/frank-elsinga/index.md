Hi, my name is Frank. 👋

I am the founder of the student club [OpenSource @ TUM e.V.](https://tum.dev/).
As part of this student club, I build an Roomfinder[^1].
Originally, said Roomfinder ran on Mapbox - Until, after two weeks, our credits ran out because we did not anticipate the growth, and being a young student club did not have the budget to just eat the costs.
We have been with [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org) and the wider [FOSS4G-movement](https://foss4g.org/) ever since and are delighted with this decision.

At MapLibre I maintain the (blazingly fast 🦀) [Martin Tileserver](https://github.com/maplibre/martin) and the maplibre-native rust wrapper [`maplibre-native-rs`](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native-rs).

[^1]: Our university has 40k rooms and really weird geometries. Architects naming rooms after the 7 (!) cardinal directions or colors, putting stairs in random places or similar is not very understandable for our students/staff.
