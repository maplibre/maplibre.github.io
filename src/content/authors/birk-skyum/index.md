Hi, I'm Birk. I'm a board member and a frequent contributor in MapLibre. I focus on getting
the long-term decisions right, and on areas that are always of interest to us, such as higher
performance, modernizing our stack, making workflows more intuitive and fostering collaboration
amongst people and teams in the open ecosystem.

The world is changing so fast, and I believe MapLibre has this unique position as an open
ecosystem to support high-quality geospatial visualizations across sciences, politics, tech and arts.
I think it's more important that ever to support this effort.
