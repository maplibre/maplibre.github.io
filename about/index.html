maintains, and promotes free, open-source software. Each project under the
MapLibre umbrella is part of the map visualization stack, from the raw data
to the map visualization and interaction.</p><p>MapLibre started as an open-source fork of the popular Mapbox rendering
libraries after their switch to a proprietary license in December 2020.
Often "MapLibre" still refers to these key rendering libraries: MapLibre GL
JS, which is a TypeScript library for rendering maps in web browsers, and
MapLibre GL Native, which is a C++ library to show maps in mobile apps on
iOS, Android, and other native targets.</p><p>As a community, we believe in building and maintaining freely licensed
libraries that enable developers worldwide to build vital tools using maps.</p><h2 class=mt-6>Governing Board</h2><p>The MapLibre Governing Board represents the broader community, defines the
overall direction of the MapLibre Organization, and has the authority over
all financial decisions. The Governing Board is elected by the MapLibre
Voting Members, see the
<a href=https://maplibre.org/charter/>MapLibre Charter</a> for more details
on our Governance.</p><p>The following people serve currently on the MapLibre Governing Board:</p><h4 class=mt-6>Birk Skyum</h4><p><a href=https://github.com/birkskyum><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74932975?v=4" width=200></a></p><p>MapLibre with its open nature is uniquely positioned to support high-quality
geospatial visualizations in science, politics, tech, and arts. Because the
world is changing so fast, it's never been more important than right now to
invest in this effort.</p><p>As a Board member of MapLibre, I'm focusing on getting the long-term
strategic decisions right, so the user story will be as simple and intuitive
as possible. That means making sure that it's trivial to use MapLibre across
web frameworks, game engines, native cross-platform compilers, etc. We will
achieve that by supporting modern graphics APIs and embracing partnerships
amongst projects in the open ecosystem.</p><h4 class=mt-6>Harel Mazor</h4><p><a href=https://github.com/HarelM><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3269297?v=4" width=200></a></p><p>I believe we have a true chance for greatness with MapLibre. As a Board
member and an Open Source promoter I believe in transparency and giving back
to the community what's rightfully theirs. Moving this project forward to
new technologies and new markets will be my main focus, making sure we
harness the power of the community by constantly updating our technology
stack.</p><p>In the day I work as a group leader in Dell Technologies and at night I'm
working on an open source hobby project called Israel Hiking Map
(co-founder) which is a small navigation app that uses Capacitor and thus
maplibre-gl-js to allow outdoor activities in Israel (hiking, biking, 4wd
driving, running etc...).</p><p>The contribution that started my journey in MapLibre was the addition of the
"addProtocol" method which opened up a world of opportunities to extend
maplibre like never before.</p><p>I've pushed forward the typescript migration along with the modernization of
the maplibre-gl-js stack, and helped with the 3D terrain effort.</p><p>I generally enjoy participating in open source projects from the development
side of things and you probably know me from the annoying code review
comments I leave when you open a PR 😊.</p><p>Feel free to check out my
<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/harel-mazor-1298b139/>LinkedIn</a>
profile, and the Israel Hiking map
<a href=https://israelhiking.osm.org.il/>website</a> and

rendering libraries are valuable for the ecosystem (from individuals to
large organizations), and that's why I initially led (along with my fearless
fellow founding members) the push to ensure there was a single,
vendor-neutral, and community-led fork of Mapbox GL JS, and I'm really
excited to see the community and engagement grow over the last years. So
far, I've been most involved in the background, from Twitter-spamming at the
beginning to build an initial group, to helping build the organizational
charter, talking to sponsors, writing organizational docs and presentations,
and ensuring we have a solid foundation for the future.</p><p>My focuses for the upcoming months:</p><ul><li>Finalize the organization structure while supporting a Governing Board
culture and habits that ensure it will succeed long-term</li><li>Ensure MapLibre GL Native becomes a much healthier project with near
parity to GL JS</li><li>Foster the continued development of MapLibre RS, a prototype of a future,
unified cross-platform renderer</li></ul><p>The company (Stadia Maps) I co founded uses MapLibre projects daily, and I
often use the libraries in small personal projects. As a result, I see a lot
of potential as the community continues to mature and collaborate, both
personally and professionally.</p><p>Here's to the strong future of MapLibre! 🚀</p><h4 class=mt-6>Petr Pridal</h4><p><a href=https://github.com/klokan><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59284?v=4" width=200></a></p><p>As one of the founders, I have had a chance to help to shape the MapLibre
project into the current form. My vision for the project is to make it the
best rendering library for maps out there - used by millions of people every
day - vendor/provider independent - and with true community governance. Many
of my ideas where to go practically are drafted in our
<a href=https://roadmap.maplibre.org/>roadmap</a>. Some of them I have
helped to make happen practically with the assistance of my team:</p><ul><li>First release of MapLibre SDK for Android and iOS (Native)</li><li>Design project logo, visual identity, presentation template, first version
of website <a href=https://maplibre.org/>https://maplibre.org</a> with
animated map and demotiles for CI and tests - all contributed to the
project as there was a need for it</li><li>Initial version of the pitch slidedeck & sponsorship presentation for
    successful fund-raising and setup of donations</li><li>Promoting the project on conferences (SOTM, FOSS4G), in press (<a href=https://opensource.com>opensource.com</a>,...) and on social media</li><li>Technical Steering Committee organization and moderation, and active work
on current Board</li></ul><p>I believe JavaScript and Native are the core and essential projects of the
MapLibre organization, and especially Native needs more love and focus right
now - to get to parity with JS. These are the cornerstones on which other
projects grow - and the success of MapLibre depends on the success of the
two. Focus is important - but there is a need for new MapLibre projects too
(hopefully the upcoming Planetiler, continued innovation in Rust or other
tools) which brings benefits to the community and allows larger reach and
will shape the project's future, and they are also really cool technically.</p><p>I am an entrepreneur and software architect. I am a challenge seeker, Swiss
resident born in the Czech Republic, and father of two boys. I hope to be
able to contribute with my experience and from my position of CEO of
<a href=https://maptiler.com>MapTiler.com</a> - acting on the board as a
representative of the vendors who are using the MapLibre in production
systems with thousands of customers. I have practical experience from board
meetings, education in management and board governance from IMD in
Switzerland, degree in Computer Science and PhD in cartography. Furthermore,
my visionary mind and workaholism helped to shape
<a href=https://openmaptiles.org>OpenMapTiles.org</a>,
<a href=https://epsg.io>EPSG.io</a>, GDAL2Tiles,
<a href=https://oldmapsonline.org>OldMapsOnline.org</a>, etc. More about
me on <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/klokan/>LinkedIn</a> and

MapLibre's future. I have served on the Board since MapLibre's inception, so
here it goes...</p><ul><li>I kick-started MapLibre via a Twitter post. There are some good replies
including the one from the Mapbox CEO just eight minutes after my initial
tweet...</li><li>Created the MapLibre GitHub organization, set up OpenCollective banking
and distributed donations acting as the organization treasurer</li><li>Coordinated and worked on initial code rebranding, CI work, and initial
NPM publishing, lots of work on charter (thanks Oliver for drafting it!),
...</li><li>Presented MapLibre at conferences like State of the Map US and the
upcoming FOSS4G</li><li>Engaged in numerous coordination and sponsorship talks with organizations
like the OSM board, Amazon, Meta (FB), Microsoft, and others, including
those at the conferences. The recent large donation from Meta, and
hopefully a few more upcoming ones are due in part to the SOTM-US
conference hallway talks.</li><li>Convinced several important repositories to join MapLibre: MapLibre-RS,
Martin, mbtileserver-rs, and hopefully soon -- Planetiler.</li><li>As a developer, I mostly hack on the backend tooling like Martin - the
tile server framework that should eventually serve from PG, mbtiles, and
other formats, as well as support server side rendering.</li></ul><p>Going forward, here is my vision and how I see my role...</p><ul><li>Listen to the community. Mediate between the needs of all contributors and
supporters, large and small. Make sure we all align on the roadmap of the
projects, both near and long term.</li><li>Make sure MapLibre stays independent from any one company, and provides
value to everyone who wants to do maps.</li><li>I think MapLibre should supply the whole stack of features for developers,
to go from the raw data like OSM and Natural Earth to the interactive map
in a browser or apps. This means MapLibre should encourage innovation at
all levels of the stack, provide tools to create and serve tiles, engage
with new standards for 3D, projections, globe to flat zooms, experiment
with joining native and javascript stacks (e.g. try Rust web assemblies),
... . The more interesting ideas we try, the more likely we will find the
good ones bringing even more value (and fun) to everyone involved.</li><li>No money for the Board - I believe it would create too much conflict of
interest if the Board is allowed to decide on money allocation, and later
turn around and receive that money. We all should decide for ourselves -
do we want to represent the community and steer the projects forward, or
do we want to receive payments for our efforts? I feel having both may put
too much power in too few hands.</li></ul><h2 class=mt-6>Meetings</h2><p>We have regular meetings where we discuss technical details,
community-related stuff, and future development.</p><p>The steering committee ensures maintained, 100% free, open-source, and
vendor-neutral project governance.</p><p>The organization is structured according to the
<a href=https://maplibre.org/charter/>Charter</a>.</p><h2 class=mt-6>Join the community</h2><p>We welcome all kinds of contributions: writing the code, designing the
website, creating documentation, testing, bug reporting, and all other
activities that help to develop this project further.</p><p>The discussion happens on the #maplibre Slack channel at
<a href=https://osmus.slack.com/>osmus.slack.com</a>. Feel free to
<a href=https://osmus-slack.herokuapp.com/>join here</a>.</p><p>Create a ticket, propose a modification, and send a pull request directly to
one of the projects on
<a href=https://github.com/maplibre>GitHub</a>.</p><h2 class=mt-6>Donate</h2><p>Sponsor via
<a href=https://github.com/sponsors/maplibre>github.com/sponsors/maplibre</a>
- with a transparent account at OpenCollective.</p><p><b>Why?</b> You ensure that the library is maintained and further developed.
