&lt;br/>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native">MapLibre Native&lt;/a> is a map rendering toolkit written in C++ that can be used on many different &lt;a href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native?tab=readme-ov-file#platforms">platforms&lt;/a>. For GPU accelerated real-time rendering, MapLibre Native traditionally relied only on the industry standard graphics API called OpenGL ES. However, in 2018 Apple announced that it would be phasing out OpenGL ES on all Apple platforms in favor of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_(API)">Metal&lt;/a>. This put MapLibre at risk of being unusable on Apple devices in the case that OpenGL ES support should be discontinued. With the new Metal rendering backend we are no longer exposed to this risk and users will benefit from the advantages of a state-of-the-art graphics framework.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Meta continues to support MapLibre</title><link>https://maplibre.org/news/2023-11-08-meta-continues-to-support-maplibre/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maplibre.org/news/2023-11-08-meta-continues-to-support-maplibre/</guid><description>&lt;p>Meta continues to support MapLibre and increases its donation from the Silver to the Gold tier in its second year of sponsorship.&lt;/p>

that will make MapLibre Native more accessible to mobile developers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project is a fork of &lt;a href="https://github.com/rnmapbox/maps">rnmapbox&lt;/a>, a community-maintained React Native library
for building maps with the Mapbox iOS and Android SDKs. The original project supported both Mapbox and MapLibre
backends for some time, but as the MapLibre SDK has developed independently over time, supporting both became onerous.
A clean break enables both projects to bring improvements and bug fixes from the native SDKs to
React Native developers as quickly as possible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MapLibre User Group Japan</title><link>https://maplibre.org/news/2023-01-23-maplibre-user-group-japan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maplibre.org/news/2023-01-23-maplibre-user-group-japan/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you speak Japanese and you are interested in map rendering, have a look at the newly created MapLibre User Group Japan.&lt;/p>
